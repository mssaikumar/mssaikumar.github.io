Thank you! I’ll gather detailed information comparing NRI and resident taxation in India from FY 2024-25 onward. This will cover both the old and new regimes, all relevant tax slabs, deductions, exemptions, and tax treatment of income sources such as interest, dividends, and capital gains. I’ll also include examples for income thresholds like ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh.

I’ll let you know once the information is ready for review.


# Comparison of NRI vs Resident Taxation in India (FY 2024-25 Onwards)

## Residential Status and Scope of Taxation

In India, tax treatment differs based on an individual’s residential status. **Resident Indians** are taxed on their **worldwide income**, whereas **Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)** are taxed **only on income earned, accrued, or received in India**. In other words, any income that arises outside India is not taxable in India for an NRI. Common taxable incomes for NRIs include salary for work in India, income from property in India, capital gains from assets in India, interest on Indian bank accounts, etc.

> **Definition:** For tax purposes, a person is typically deemed “NRI” if they do not meet the residency criteria (e.g. stay in India < 182 days in the year, among other tests). If you qualify as an NRI, your foreign income is exempt in India, unlike a resident whose global income is taxed.

## Income Tax Regimes and Slab Rates (FY 2024-25)

India currently has two parallel tax regimes for individuals: the **old (existing) tax regime** with various deductions/exemptions, and the **new concessional tax regime** with lower slab rates but minimal deductions. The new regime (introduced in 2020 and revamped in 2023-24) is now the **default** from FY 2023-24 onward, though taxpayers (including NRIs) can choose the old regime if it’s beneficial.

**Tax Slabs and Rates:** The tax slabs differ between the two regimes, and some thresholds were updated from FY 2023-24 (Budget 2023) and FY 2024-25 (Budget 2024):

* **Old Regime Slabs (FY 2024-25):** Unchanged from previous years. For individuals <60 years, income up to ₹2.5 lakh is tax-free; ₹2.5–5 lakh is taxed at 5%; ₹5–10 lakh at 20%; and above ₹10 lakh at 30%. (Residents aged 60–79 have a higher basic exemption of ₹3 lakh; residents 80+ have ₹5 lakh. However, **for all NRIs the basic exemption limit remains ₹2.5 lakh regardless of age**.) Surcharge rates for high incomes in the old regime can go up to 37% (for income > ₹5 cr).

* **New Regime Slabs (FY 2024-25):** Post-Budget 2023 and 2024 adjustments, the new regime slabs are more liberal. Income up to ₹3 lakh is tax-free; ₹3–7 lakh at 5%; ₹7–10 lakh at 10%; ₹10–12 lakh at 15%; ₹12–15 lakh at 20%; and above ₹15 lakh at 30%. (These slabs apply equally to all individuals under the new regime, without any extra exemption for senior citizens.) The new regime also caps the highest surcharge at 25%, so the maximum effective tax rate is lower than under the old regime.

For quick reference, the following table compares the slab rates under each regime for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26):

| **Taxable Income** (₹) | **Old Regime Tax** | **New Regime Tax** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0 – 2,50,000           | 0% (Nil)           | 0% (Nil)           |
| 2,50,001 – 3,00,000    | 5%                 | 0% (Nil)           |
| 3,00,001 – 5,00,000    | 5%                 | 5%                 |
| 5,00,001 – 7,00,000    | 20%                | 5%                 |
| 7,00,001 – 10,00,000   | 20%                | 10%                |
| 10,00,001 – 12,00,000  | 30%                | 15%                |
| 12,00,001 – 15,00,000  | 30%                | 20%                |
| Above 15,00,000        | 30%                | 30%                |

*Table: Old vs New Regime slab rates for FY 2024-25. Under the old regime, resident seniors have higher exemptions (not reflected in this general table), whereas NRIs have no age-based benefit (₹2.5L basic limit).*

**Note:** These rates are before any rebates or cess. A 4% health & education cess applies on the final tax for both residents and NRIs. Also, the new regime slab shown above is after the Budget 2024 changes which extended the 5% slab to ₹7 lakh (earlier it was up to ₹6L).

## Rebate and Basic Exemption Differences

One of the **key differences** in treatment is the eligibility for the **tax rebate under Section 87A** and higher basic exemptions for seniors:

* **87A Rebate:** This rebate provides 100% tax relief up to a certain income threshold, effectively making incomes up to that limit tax-free. **Residents** can avail this rebate if their total taxable income does not exceed ₹5 lakh (under old regime) or ₹7 lakh (under new regime). The rebate covers tax up to ₹12,500 (old regime) or ₹25,000 (new regime). **NRIs, however, are *not eligible* for the Section 87A rebate**. This means an NRI will have to pay tax on even small taxable incomes above ₹2.5L, whereas a resident could pay zero tax on the same income if it falls under the rebate limit.

* **Basic Exemption for Senior Citizens:** Resident senior citizens get a higher tax-exempt income limit (₹3,00,000 for age 60-79, and ₹5,00,000 for age 80+) under the old regime. In contrast, an **NRI does not get any higher exemption based on age** – the exemption limit remains ₹2.5L for an NRI even if they are, say, 65 or 80 years old. (Under the new regime, the basic ₹3L exemption applies uniformly; senior citizen benefits are built into the old regime only.)

**Implication:** A resident individual with ₹5 lakh income ends up paying **zero tax** due to the rebate, but an NRI with ₹5 lakh income would incur tax because they cannot claim 87A rebate. Similarly, a resident super-senior (80+) can have up to ₹5L income tax-free due to the higher basic limit, whereas an NRI octogenarian has to pay tax on income beyond ₹2.5L.

## Standard Deduction (Salary/Pension)

The **standard deduction** for salary and pensioners is another area that saw recent changes and applies to both residents and NRIs having such income:

* Under the old regime, salaried individuals (and pensioners) can claim a flat **₹50,000 standard deduction** from their salary income. This benefit is available to NRIs as well if they have salary income taxable in India. (For example, an NRI receiving an Indian pension or salary from employment in India can reduce ₹50k from that income just like a resident can.)

* Initially, the new regime had no standard deduction, but from FY 2023-24 onwards, the government introduced it. **For FY 2024-25, the standard deduction under the new regime has been **increased to ₹75,000** (from the earlier ₹50,000) for salaried taxpayers.** This means under the new regime, a salary earner gets ₹75k deduction off their income (making the effective tax-free salary ₹3.75L, since ₹3L slab + ₹75k deduction). Pensioners under the new regime likewise get this benefit. (Family pensioners’ standard deduction was also increased from ₹15k to ₹25k in new regime.)

* For NRIs, if they draw a salary from an Indian source, they are equally eligible for the standard deduction in whichever regime they choose. If an NRI has no salary or pension income (common for many NRIs who earn mainly investment income), standard deduction wouldn’t be applicable.

**Example:** Under the new regime, a resident or NRI with a ₹7.5 lakh salary would have taxable income ₹7.5L–₹75k = ₹6.75L, which qualifies for full rebate (since taxable ≤ ₹7L) resulting in no tax. This highlights how the increased standard deduction and rebate can eliminate tax for moderate salaries. Under the old regime, the same person’s taxable income would be ₹7L (after ₹50k deduction) and tax \~₹*zero* after 87A rebate if resident (but \~₹12,500 if NRI, as NRI can’t claim the rebate).

## Deductions and Exemptions (80C, 80D, etc.)

The old tax regime allows various **deductions under Chapter VI-A** (Sections 80C to 80U) and certain **exemptions**, which can reduce taxable income. Both residents and NRIs are eligible for many of these, but there are some differences in availability and usage:

* **Section 80C (Investments/Expenses up to ₹1.5 lakh):** **NRIs are eligible to claim most 80C deductions similar to residents.** This includes life insurance premiums for self, spouse or children, tuition fees for children in India, principal repayment of home loans, ULIPs, and ELSS mutual fund investments, etc.. For example, an NRI investing in an ELSS tax-saving fund or paying LIC premiums can avail the ₹1.5L deduction like any resident. However, some 80C avenues are practically not accessible to NRIs: NRIs **cannot open new Public Provident Fund (PPF) accounts** (though they may continue one started as a resident), and they cannot invest in National Savings Certificates, 5-year Post Office deposits, or Senior Citizen Savings Scheme while non-resident. (Thus, an NRI’s 80C options are effectively limited to things like insurance, ELSS, loan repayment, etc., rather than small savings schemes.)

* **Section 80D (Health Insurance):** NRIs can also claim **medical insurance premium deductions under 80D** just like residents. This means up to ₹25,000 for health insurance of self, spouse, kids, and an additional ₹25,000 for parents (₹50,000 if parents are senior citizens) can be deducted. Preventive health check-up costs (₹5,000 limit within the above) are also included. An NRI paying for a family floater mediclaim or parents’ health insurance in India can use this deduction.

* **Sections 80E, 80G, 80TTA, etc.:** NRIs are eligible for **80E (interest on education loan) deduction** with no upper limit (for up to 8 years), and for **80G (charitable donations)** to approved institutions, same as residents. NRIs can also claim **80TTA** deduction on interest from savings accounts in India – up to ₹10,000 off the interest income. (This typically applies if they have an NRO savings account accruing interest.)

* **Deductions *not* available to NRIs:** Certain deductions are exclusive to resident taxpayers. Notably, **Section 80TTB (interest deduction for senior citizens up to ₹50,000)** is **NOT applicable to NRIs**, even if they are senior in age. This means a resident senior (60+) can deduct up to ₹50k of bank interest, but an NRI senior cannot – they fall back on 80TTA’s ₹10k limit. Additionally, deductions for disability and dependent care (80U for self disability, 80DD for disabled dependents, 80DDB for specified diseases) are generally not available to NRIs. The now-defunct 80CCG (RGESS) was also not available to NRIs.

* **Home Loan and House Property:** For a house property in India, NRIs get the same benefits as residents on a rented property – e.g. **30% standard deduction on rental income, municipal taxes deduction, and home loan interest deduction** up to ₹2 lakh for a self-occupied home loan interest. They can also claim principal repayment under 80C as noted. In short, rental income is taxed similarly and NRIs can reduce it with the same deductions (interest, taxes, etc.) as a resident.

**New Regime:** It’s important to note that **under the new tax regime, nearly all the above deductions and exemptions are *forfeited*** for both residents and NRIs. Neither can claim 80C, 80D, 80E, 80G, etc., if they opt for the new regime (except employer NPS contribution under 80CCD(2) is allowed). The new regime basically taxes income at the concessional slab rates without these deductions. The only deductions allowed in new regime (FY 2024-25) are the standard deduction (₹75k as discussed) and employer’s contribution to NPS (up to 10% of salary or 14% for government employees). Therefore, the above list of deductions mainly matters if one stays in the old regime. NRIs who don’t or can’t utilize many deductions might find the new regime’s lower rates more beneficial, whereas those who have significant deductions (e.g. large 80C investments, home loan interest) may prefer the old regime even though the rates are higher.

## Taxation of Different Income Types

Different categories of income are taxed in specific ways, and we highlight any distinctions in how NRIs are taxed versus residents:

### 1. **Interest Income (Bank Accounts and Deposits)**

* **Residents:** Interest from bank fixed deposits (FDs) and recurring deposits, as well as interest from savings accounts, is **fully taxable at the applicable slab rates**. However, residents get minor relief through **Section 80TTA** which allows deduction of ₹10,000 on interest from savings accounts (not FDs) for non-seniors. Residents who are senior citizens (60+) get a larger **Section 80TTB** deduction up to ₹50,000 on all bank interest (savings + deposits) in lieu of 80TTA. Banks deduct TDS @ 10% on FD interest for residents if interest exceeds ₹40,000 in a year (₹50,000 for senior citizens).

* **NRIs:** Interest on NRIs’ **NRO accounts** (the ordinary rupee account) and any FDs in India is also fully taxable at slab rates. NRIs can claim **80TTA** on their NRO savings account interest (₹10k limit) just like residents. **They are *not eligible* for the 80TTB ₹50k senior interest deduction**, even if they are senior by age. On the other hand, interest from an **NRE (Non-Resident External) rupee account or FCNR (Foreign Currency Non-Resident) deposit is entirely tax-exempt in India** for NRIs. (This is a significant benefit for NRIs – e.g. interest on an NRE fixed deposit is not taxed at all, whereas a resident’s FD interest would be.)

  Also, the TDS on interest paid to NRIs is higher: banks will deduct **TDS @ 30% on NRO deposit interest** (plus cess/surcharge) under Section 195, unless a lower treaty rate is applicable. In contrast, a resident’s bank FD TDS is 10%. NRIs can avail DTAA benefits to reduce the TDS on interest (for example, DTAA with the U.S. caps interest tax at 15%) by submitting a Tax Residency Certificate and Form 10F to the bank (discussed later).

### 2. **Dividend Income**

* **Residents:** Dividends received from Indian companies or mutual funds are treated as **“Income from Other Sources” and taxed at slab rates** in the hands of the investor. Ever since the abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax, shareholders must include dividends in their taxable income. Resident individuals get a TDS at 10% on dividend payments exceeding ₹5,000 per company per year (small dividends typically have no TDS). There is no special tax rate for dividends – but an individual’s effective tax on them could be mitigated by slab and rebate if total income is low.

* **NRIs:** For NRIs, **dividends from Indian companies/mutual funds are also taxable at slab rates**, just like for residents. The crucial difference lies in **withholding**: dividends paid to NRIs are subject to **TDS @ 20%** (plus surcharge/cess) by the company declaring the dividend (Section 115A and 195). There is no ₹5,000 threshold for NRIs – even ₹100 of dividend to an NRI will face 20% TDS. If the NRI is in a lower tax bracket (say 5% or 0% after deductions), they would have to file a return to claim a refund of the excess TDS. Alternatively, **NRIs can avail of DTAA** provisions to reduce tax on dividends – many treaties allow a lower tax rate (often 10% or 15%). To utilize this, the NRI must provide a TRC and Form 10F so that the Indian company withholds at the treaty rate. In summary, the **final tax rate on dividends is the same for residents and NRIs (per slab)**, but NRIs often face higher upfront TDS and need to use treaties or refunds to ensure they don’t overpay.

### 3. **Capital Gains (Stocks, Mutual Funds, Property, etc.)**

Capital gains tax rules are generally uniform for all taxpayers, but there are a few special provisions and recent changes affecting NRIs:

* **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):** If equity shares or equity mutual fund units are sold within 12 months, the gain is considered short-term and taxed at a flat **15%** (this is under Section 111A for equity-oriented investments) for both residents and NRIs. STCG on other assets (debt funds held <36 months if bought before April 2023, property held <24 months, etc.) is taxed at the **normal slab rates** applicable to the individual. NRIs similarly pay 15% on short-term equity gains and slab rates on other short-term gains. One difference: NRIs will have **TDS deducted on capital gains** – e.g. a 15% TDS on short-term equity gains, or even 30% TDS on short-term property gains (since property STCG is taxed at slab, buyer must withhold up to 30%). Residents typically do not have TDS on capital gains (except in property transactions at 1%). Thus NRIs might need to file returns to reconcile any TDS overpaid. *(See compliance section for property TDS issues.)*

* **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** Long-term gains on equities (shares/mutual funds held >1 year) are taxed at **10% (plus cess) on the amount exceeding ₹1 lakh** (the first ₹1L of such gains in a year is exempt for everyone). Long-term gains on other assets like real estate or gold (held >2 years) or debt mutual funds (held >3 years for units purchased before 2023) are taxed at **20% with indexation benefit**. These rates apply to both residents and NRIs as per Section 112/112A. The major difference for NRIs is again in **withholding**: for example, when an NRI sells property, the buyer is required to deduct TDS at 20% of the sale consideration (for long-term) which often is a high amount relative to the actual tax (which is 20% of *capital gain*, not sale price). The NRI can later claim refund of excess TDS after computing indexed gains and exemptions. In contrast, a resident seller faces only 1% TDS on property sale (and must pay the remaining tax via self-assessment). **Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA)** do not typically reduce capital gains tax (India usually retains taxing rights on immovable property and domestic securities), so NRIs mostly rely on Indian provisions for relief (like exemptions or refunds).

* **Special NRI Provisions (Chapter XII-A):** NRIs have an option to be taxed under special provisions for certain investment income and long-term gains. If an NRI’s **long-term capital gain** arises from foreign-currency assets (like shares or debentures in Indian companies acquired in foreign currency), they can pay tax at a flat **10%** on such gains without indexation or ₹1L exemption. Similarly, specific **investment income** (like interest or dividends from such foreign-currency investments) can be taxed at a flat 20%. These special rates are meant to simplify taxation for NRIs. However, under this scheme, **no deductions under Chapter VI-A or basic exemption are available** against these incomes. Many NRIs simply use the normal provisions, since for listed equities the normal rate (10% with ₹1L exemption) may be more favorable than 10% on the entire gain. But for assets like unlisted shares or bonds, the 10% without indexation could be beneficial compared to 20% with index for long term. If an NRI opts for these special rates and the due TDS is deducted, they are **not required to file a tax return** in India, provided they have no other income (this can be useful if an NRI has, say, only interest and capital gains with proper TDS).

* **Budget 2024 Changes:** Starting FY 2024-25, the government introduced certain **changes specifically affecting NRIs’ capital gains taxes** to streamline processes. In Union Budget 2024, it was indicated that for NRIs, **long-term capital gains on property and unlisted assets would be taxed at 12.5% without indexation instead of 20% with indexation** (which is the rate for residents). Likewise, **short-term gains on listed equity** for NRIs may be taxed at **20% instead of 15%**, and **long-term gains on listed equity at 12.5% (with an increased ₹1.25 lakh exemption)**. These changes essentially align with reducing TDS and eliminating indexation complexities – for example, TDS on NRI property sales was reduced from 20% to 12.5% of sale value in line with the new flat rate. *However, these rules are nuanced and were a subject of Budget 2024 proposals.* The net effect is that NRIs could see slightly higher tax on equity gains but lower withholding on property sales going forward. (Residents were not subject to these particular changes – they continue with 10%/20% rates with indexation for assets like property.) NRIs should keep an eye on the Finance Act provisions for the year and possibly consult a tax advisor to understand the optimal approach (e.g. whether to apply indexation or the flat rate) for FY 2024-25 and beyond.

**Capital Gains Exemptions:** Both residents and NRIs are eligible for exemptions on long-term capital gains by reinvesting proceeds, such as **Section 54, 54F, 54EC** (reinvestment in another house, or specified bonds, etc.). NRIs can avail these by filing a return and claiming the exemption; even if TDS was deducted on the sale, a refund can be obtained. For instance, an NRI selling a house in India can invest in another property in India within the stipulated time and claim Section 54 exemption, similar to a resident. They would then be refunded the TDS that was initially deducted on the gain. The key difference is procedural: the buyer of the property must deduct TDS unless the NRI obtains a lower-TDS certificate in advance. Recent reforms aim to simplify this by lowering the default TDS rate for certain NRI gains.

### 4. **Other Income Categories**

* **Rental Income:** Taxation of rent from property in India is identical for residents and NRIs. It is taxable under “Income from House Property” after a standard 30% deduction for maintenance and deduction for property taxes. NRIs can also deduct home loan interest if the property is rented (or claim the ₹2L interest deduction if it’s self-occupied/deemed let out, subject to the usual conditions). The difference is in TDS – a tenant renting from an NRI must deduct TDS at 30% on the rent before paying the NRI owner, whereas tenants normally do not deduct TDS when paying rent to a resident (unless the rent exceeds ₹50,000 per month per Section 194IB at 5%). So NRIs often face tax via TDS on rent through compliance imposed on the tenant. The ultimate tax calculated is the same as for any owner; excess TDS can be refunded after the NRI files a return.

* **Business/Professional Income:** If an NRI has income from a business or profession controlled/set up in India, it is taxable in India as well (similar to a resident). Deductions for business expenses can be claimed. In practice, most NRIs won’t have active business income in India unless they have ongoing business operations; if they do, they would be taxed similarly to residents on the Indian-source business profits.

* **Foreign Income:** For completeness, any income an NRI earns abroad (say salary in the USA or rental income from a house in Dubai) is **not taxable in India**, whereas a resident would have to declare it and possibly claim foreign tax credit under DTAA. This is a fundamental difference stemming from the residential status and is why many returning NRIs choose to plan their return to maintain RNOR status for a while (RNORs are residents but still exempt on certain foreign income).

## Tax Calculation Scenarios: ₹2.5 Lakh vs ₹5 Lakh Income

To illustrate the impact of the above rules, consider two basic scenarios (assuming no special deductions):

* **Scenario 1: Annual Income = ₹2.5 lakh.** This level of income is at the basic exemption limit for a resident individual (below 60) and also for an NRI.

  * A **resident** (old or new regime) would have **no tax** payable on ₹2.5L, since it is within the tax-free slab. A senior resident or super-senior would also pay zero tax (in fact, a resident senior could have up to ₹3L and a super-senior up to ₹5L tax-free due to higher exemption). The 87A rebate isn’t needed here because the income is not exceeding the exemption.
  * An **NRI** with ₹2.5 lakh income also pays **zero tax**, as it does not exceed the ₹2.5L basic exemption for NRIs. There is no difference in outcome at this income level – neither owes any tax. (One caveat: if that ₹2.5L is composed solely of certain special kinds of income like short-term capital gains on equities, the flat rate tax might apply instead of slab; but generally speaking, ₹2.5L of normal income will be zero tax for both.)

* **Scenario 2: Annual Income = ₹5 lakh.** This is a critical threshold where residents get full rebate, but NRIs do not:

  * A **resident individual** with ₹5,00,000 taxable income will pay **₹0 tax in both old and new regimes**, thanks to Section 87A. For example, under the old regime, the tax on ₹5L would be ₹12,500 (5% of ₹2.5L above the exemption), but then a rebate of ₹12,500 is applied, making net tax zero. Under the new regime, ₹5L falls below the ₹7L rebate ceiling, so similarly the ₹12,500 tax gets rebated in full. Thus, residents effectively pay nothing on ₹5L income.
  * An **NRI** with ₹5,00,000 taxable income **does not get any rebate**, and therefore **will have to pay tax**. Under the old regime, their tax would be \~₹12,500 (5% of the ₹2.5L above the ₹2.5L basic exemption) plus cess, totaling about ₹13,000. Under the new regime, the NRI’s tax on ₹5L would be around ₹10,000 (since ₹3L is exempt, 5% on the remaining ₹2L = ₹10k) plus cess \~₹10,400. In either case, the NRI ends up with a tax liability of roughly ₹10–12K, whereas a resident pays ₹0 on the same income. This stark difference is solely because the NRI cannot avail the 87A tax rebate which is reserved for resident taxpayers.

If the NRI had eligible deductions, they could reduce their taxable income below ₹2.5L to eliminate tax, but without deductions, an NRI at ₹5L income will incur some tax. A resident under the same circumstances would not, due to the rebate. This demonstrates how at lower income levels, **residents get an edge (zero tax up to ₹5L/₹7L)** whereas NRIs start getting taxed beyond ₹2.5L of income.

*(For incomes above these levels, both residents and NRIs will be paying tax according to slabs, with the earlier-noted differences in deductions and rebates. Notably, a resident with ₹7L taxable under the new regime also pays zero (rebate available), while an NRI with ₹7L would pay about ₹26k tax under new regime rates since no rebate.)*

## NRI-Specific Compliance and Reporting Obligations

NRIs should be aware of certain compliance requirements when it comes to taxation in India, especially to avail treaty benefits and to ensure correct tax withholding:

* **Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) and Form 10F for DTAA:** If an NRI wants to claim benefits under a **Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)** (for example, reduced TDS rates on interest or dividends, or to claim foreign tax credit), they must obtain a **Tax Residency Certificate** from their country of residence and provide it to the deductor or the tax authorities. In addition, **Form 10F** must be furnished, which captures details like the NRI’s tax residency status, country, and tax identification number (if not fully mentioned in the TRC). **To avail lower or nil tax rates under a DTAA, an NRI *must* submit both the TRC and Form 10F to the payer or the Income Tax Department.** Failing to do so can result in the NRI’s income being taxed at the standard (often higher) rates without treaty relief. For example, interest income might be subject to 30% TDS instead of, say, 15% under treaty if Form 10F/TRC are not given.

  *Recent Update:* Since 2022, the Income Tax department has **mandated electronic filing of Form 10F** on the e-filing portal for those NRIs who are required to file an Indian tax return. Initially, this posed challenges for NRIs without a PAN or those not registered on the portal. The department provided interim relaxations (allowing manual submission until Sep 2023 for NRIs without PAN). Now, even an NRI without a PAN can **register as a “non-PAN holder”** on the tax portal to electronically file Form 10F. In practical terms, if you’re an NRI receiving Indian income and wish to claim treaty benefits at source, you should ensure the deductor has your TRC and Form 10F. If you plan to claim treaty relief when filing your tax return (for example, to avoid double taxation of a pension or to get credit for taxes paid abroad), you’ll attach the TRC and Form 10F with your ITR. The **bottom line** is that proper documentation is key to **avoid double taxation**, and India has tightened compliance to use treaty provisions.

* **Filing of Tax Returns:** An NRI is required to file an income tax return in India for a given financial year if their **gross total income (before Chapter VI-A deductions)** exceeds the basic exemption (₹2.5 lakh) – same as the rule for residents. Even if income is below ₹2.5L, a return may be filed to claim TDS refunds or carry forward losses. One exception unique to NRIs: if the NRI’s **only income is investment income or long-term capital gains covered by the special NRI provisions and proper TDS has been deducted**, they are not obliged to file a return. For example, if an NRI only earned interest which had 30% TDS and no refund is due, they can skip filing (though many still file to document everything). However, if an NRI wants to claim any **exemption on capital gains (Sections 54/54F/54EC)** or a refund of excess TDS, they **must file a return**. It’s also advisable to file if you have any carry-forward losses or if global income needs to be reported for claiming foreign tax credit, etc.

* **Higher TDS in Certain Cases:** As noted, many payments to NRIs attract higher TDS by default (e.g. 20% on dividends, 30% on NRO interest, up to 30% on property sale proceeds). NRIs can **apply for a lower TDS certificate** from the tax officer u/s 197 to direct the payer to deduct tax only on the estimated capital gain portion for asset sales, which can ease cash-flow. Otherwise, one must prepare for significant TDS and then seek refunds. The Indian government, acknowledging hardships, has proposed aligning some NRI TDS rates with resident rates (for instance, bringing down property sale TDS), but many differences still remain. NRIs receiving rent from a property should also ensure the tenant knows how to deposit the TDS to the government and provide Form 16A to the NRI for tax credit.

* **Foreign Assets Reporting:** While this is more relevant to residents, it’s worth noting: Residents must disclose foreign assets and income in their Indian tax return. NRIs, on the other hand, **do not need to report foreign assets** to Indian authorities in the annual return. If an NRI becomes Resident and Ordinarily Resident (ROR), then global assets come into picture. There’s a transitional status called **Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR)** which returning NRIs can enjoy for a limited period – RNORs are not taxed on foreign income (like NRIs) but are otherwise treated as residents for other purposes. This is a niche aspect: e.g. RNORs actually can claim Section 87A rebate since they are residents, but they remain exempt on qualifying foreign income. The key takeaway is, as long as you are an NRI, India taxes only your Indian income, and you generally don’t have to disclose offshore bank accounts, etc., in the Indian tax return.

* **PAN and Aadhaar:** NRIs should maintain a **PAN (Permanent Account Number)** if they have taxable income or wish to invest in India. NRIs are *exempt* from the requirement of linking PAN with Aadhaar (since many NRIs may not have Aadhaar). The government has clarified that the PAN of non-residents will not be invalidated for not linking with Aadhaar, provided they are truly non-resident as per the Aadhaar Act. It is wise for an NRI to ensure their PAN status reflects the NRI status (by updating their Aadhaar-exemption or through the new portal category for non-PAN registration if applicable).

* **Financial Account Management:** This is beyond taxation per se, but NRIs must convert their resident bank accounts to NRO/NRE accounts upon changing status, and similarly update their residential status for investments (demat accounts, etc.) to comply with FEMA. While not directly a tax law point, failing to do so could complicate TDS and tax reporting (e.g. interest in a resident account would not get the NRE tax exemption).

## Key Differences Summary: Resident vs NRI Taxation

To summarize, here are the **key differences in tax treatment between residents and NRIs** in India:

* **Scope of Taxable Income:** Residents are taxed on worldwide income; NRIs are only taxed on income sourced from or received in India. Foreign income is off the table for NRIs (except income from a business controlled in India). Residents must report global income and can claim foreign tax credit under DTAA, whereas NRIs typically use DTAA to reduce Indian taxes on Indian income.

* **Basic Exemption Limit:** NRIs have a flat basic exemption of ₹2.5 lakh. They **do not get higher exemptions for senior or super-senior age**. Residents get ₹3 lakh or ₹5 lakh basic exemption if they are senior citizens (under the old regime). Under the new regime, the basic ₹3L exemption applies to everyone (resident or NRI) by design, but residents additionally benefit from rebate up to ₹7L.

* **Tax Rebate (Section 87A):** Only **resident individuals** can claim the 87A rebate that makes their tax zero up to ₹5L (old regime) or ₹7L (new regime). **NRIs cannot claim this rebate**, regardless of income level or regime. This often results in NRIs paying tax on moderate incomes where residents pay none (e.g. ₹5L, ₹6L ranges, as illustrated).

* **Deductions and Exemptions:** Broadly, NRIs are eligible for most of the popular deductions (80C, 80D, 80E, 80G, etc.) except a few. Notable differences:

  * NRIs cannot invest in schemes like PPF, NSC, SCSS, etc., so those specific 80C deductions aren’t available.
  * Deductions for disability (80U, 80DD, 80DDB) are not available to NRIs.
  * The special interest deduction for resident seniors (80TTB) is not available to NRIs.
  * Otherwise, NRIs can use 80C (insurance, ELSS, housing loan principal, tuition fees), 80D (medical insurance), and others similarly. Under the new regime, neither NRIs nor residents can use most deductions (aside from the few allowed like standard deduction).

* **Standard Deduction:** Available to both, but quantum differs by regime. In old regime, ₹50k standard deduction for salary/pension for everyone (residents and NRIs alike, if they have such income). In the new regime, ₹75k standard deduction (FY 24-25) for salary/pension is available. No difference here except NRIs only benefit if they actually earn salary/pension in India.

* **Tax Rates and Slabs:** The nominal slab rates are the same for a given regime, but the **new regime has become particularly beneficial with higher rebate and lower surcharge for residents**, effectively making up to ₹7L tax-free for them. For NRIs, the new regime’s lower slabs still apply, but the lack of rebate means they’ll pay some tax on the same income. At high incomes, the new regime caps surcharge at 25%, which benefits high-earning NRIs too (their max rate is \~39% vs \~42.7% in old regime). In the old regime, surcharge rates and slabs by income apply equally to residents and NRIs (e.g., >₹50L 10%, >₹1Cr 15%, >₹2Cr 25%, >₹5Cr 37% – no difference by residential status).

* **Taxation of Specific Incomes:**

  * **Interest:** NRE/FCNR interest is tax-free for NRIs (residents don’t have such accounts). NRO interest is taxable; NRIs get 80TTA but not 80TTB. TDS on NRO interest is 30% vs 10% for residents’ FDs.
  * **Dividends:** Taxable at slab for both, but TDS for NRIs is 20% vs 10% (with threshold) for residents.
  * **Capital Gains:** In general, rates (15% STCG equity, 10% LTCG equity, 20% other LTCG) apply to both. Differences arise in *withholding* (property sale TDS 20%/30% for NRI vs 1% for resident) and in some Budget 2024 tweaks that target NRIs (flat 12.5% rates on certain LTCGs). NRIs also have the option of special investment income taxation at concessional rates (20%/10% without indexation) which residents don’t use. Both can claim exemptions on LTCG by reinvestment (Sections 54/54F, etc.), though NRIs must file returns to get refund of TDS in such cases.
  * **Rental Income:** Tax computed is same, but an NRI’s tenant must deduct 30% TDS on rent, whereas a resident’s tenant usually does not (except in high rent cases).
  * **Other incomes** like business/profession or lottery winnings are taxed similarly at applicable rates. Lottery/gameshow winnings, for instance, have TDS 30% for both residents and NRIs (section 115BB).

* **Compliance:** NRIs have extra steps to manage tax on their Indian income:

  * Must furnish **TRC + Form 10F** to claim DTAA benefits for lower tax rates.
  * Subject to **higher TDS** on many incomes (necessitating refunds or careful planning).
  * **Form 15CA/15CB**: When repatriating funds from India, NRIs or payers often need to file Form 15CA and an accountant’s certificate in 15CB for remittances above certain amounts – this is a procedural requirement to ensure taxes are paid on the funds being sent out. Residents generally don’t deal with this except when sending money abroad.
  * NRIs are exempt from Aadhaar-PAN linking (while residents must do it).
  * On return to India, NRIs should be aware of RNOR status which can give short-term relief on foreign income.

In conclusion, from FY 2024-25 onward, Indian tax law has increasingly catered to **simplifying NRI taxation** (e.g., tweaking capital gain rates and TDS) while **maintaining a distinction** between residents and NRIs for certain benefits (like rebates and some deductions). NRIs should plan their investments and choose the tax regime by considering these differences. For instance, an NRI with no Indian deductions may lean towards the new regime for lower rates, but one with a home loan and insurance investments might save more in the old regime despite higher rates, since they can significantly reduce taxable income. It’s always recommended for NRIs to evaluate both regimes each year and stay updated on budget changes. By understanding the above comparisons, one can optimize tax outgo and ensure full compliance whether they are a resident or an NRI.

**Sources:** The comparison above is based on the Income Tax Act as amended up to Finance Act 2024, various tax guides and expert commentary, and relevant provisions applicable to NRIs. Key references include Economic Times reports on budget changes, NRI tax guides (SBNRI, IDFC) clarifying rebate and deduction eligibility, and government circulars on compliance requirements. This ensures the information reflects the latest rules in FY 2024-25 and onward.
