Thanks! I’ll prepare a detailed summary of your U.S. tax obligations as a resident alien on H-1B with income and investments in India. This will include:

* How your tax treatment compares to that of a U.S. citizen
* Reporting requirements for Indian financial accounts and assets
* Taxation and disclosure of Indian income (interest, dividends, capital gains)
* Implications of future asset sales in India (property and stocks)
* Use of Foreign Tax Credit or tax treaty benefits to avoid double taxation
* Any additional compliance obligations (like FBAR, FATCA)
  I’ll get back to you shortly with a full breakdown.


# U.S. Tax Compliance for an H-1B Resident Alien with Indian Income

## Tax Treatment: Resident Alien vs. U.S. Citizen

For U.S. income tax purposes, a **resident alien** (e.g. an H-1B visa holder who meets the substantial presence test) is generally treated the same as a U.S. citizen. Both are considered U.S. tax residents, which means they must **file Form 1040 and report worldwide income** just as citizens do. In other words, **all income from any source worldwide is subject to U.S. tax for a resident alien**, similar to a citizen. This contrasts with nonresident aliens, who are only taxed on U.S.-source income.

Your **filing status (Single vs. Married Filing Jointly)** does not change the obligation to report worldwide income, though it can affect tax rates and certain thresholds. If you are married to a non-U.S. spouse, you have the option to elect to treat your spouse as a U.S. resident for tax and file jointly. By making this election, **both you and your spouse are then taxed on worldwide income and must file a joint return**. (If you do so, neither of you can claim nonresident treaty benefits for that year.) In later years you can choose to file jointly or separately, but regardless, as long as you are a U.S. tax resident, you are subject to U.S. tax on all your income. Essentially, a resident alien’s U.S. tax obligations are **equivalent to those of a U.S. citizen** in scope and reporting.

## Reporting Foreign Income (India) on U.S. Tax Returns

**Yes – all income from India must be reported on your U.S. tax return.** U.S. law requires citizens and resident aliens to **report worldwide income**, regardless of where it is earned. This includes passive income such as **interest, dividends**, and **capital gains** from Indian investments. Even if the income is kept in India or never remitted to the U.S., it must still be reported. For example, interest from an Indian bank account, dividends from Indian stocks, or capital gains from selling Indian securities are all **reportable on your U.S. 1040**. In fact, IRS guidance explicitly notes that any income generated from foreign assets – including interest, dividends, rental income, and capital gains – must be included on your U.S. tax return.

It’s important to note that **U.S. tax applies even if the income is tax-free or taxed at a favorable rate in India**. India-specific exemptions do not carry over to U.S. taxes. For instance, India offers tax exemptions on certain instruments (like interest on some NRE accounts or long-term gains up to a limit on equities), but the U.S. will tax those earnings in full if you are a U.S. tax resident. As one cross-border tax guide explains, **income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, PPF interest, mutual fund gains, etc., even if tax-exempt in India, may still be taxable in the U.S.**. Always convert foreign income to U.S. dollars using the appropriate exchange rates for reporting on your return.

**How to report:** You will report Indian-source income on the same forms/schedules as U.S. income. For example: interest and dividends are reported on Schedule B (with the totals flowing to Form 1040). On **Schedule B, Part III**, you must also **declare any foreign bank accounts** and indicate the country of each account. Capital gains (from sales of Indian stocks or other capital assets) are reported on Form 8949 and Schedule D, just like U.S. capital transactions. It’s crucial to maintain records of **purchase and sale dates, cost basis, and exchange rates** for any assets sold in India, so you can accurately compute U.S. capital gains or losses in USD terms. Meticulous recordkeeping (e.g. property purchase documents, improvement costs, and the INR-USD conversion rate at purchase and sale) will support your reported figures and help avoid discrepancies.

Bottom line: **all Indian income, whether passive earnings or capital gains, must be disclosed on your U.S. return**. Failing to report foreign income can lead to penalties, so be thorough and report it every year.

## U.S. Taxation of Indian Stock Sales and Property Gains

If you **sell Indian stocks or property while a U.S. tax resident**, those sales have U.S. tax implications. The U.S. taxes capital gains on worldwide assets, so you must **report the sale and any gain or loss on your U.S. tax return**, just as you would for selling U.S. investments. This is true even though the asset is located in India – the U.S. worldwide taxation means the location of the sale doesn’t exempt it from U.S. tax.

**For Indian stock sales:** When you sell shares of Indian companies or other securities, determine the capital gain or loss in USD. The gain is typically the difference between the sale price and your cost basis (purchase price plus any associated costs), converted to USD. If you held the stock for more than one year, it will be a long-term capital gain, eligible for U.S. long-term capital gains tax rates (0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income level). Short-term holdings (one year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates. Be aware that India may levy a tax on the stock sale as well (for example, India currently imposes a 15% tax on short-term equity gains and 10% on certain long-term equity gains for non-residents, after a small exemption). **You still must report the full gain on your U.S. return**, but any Indian tax paid can potentially be claimed as a foreign tax credit (discussed below) to avoid double taxation. There is no blanket U.S. tax exemption for foreign stock gains, so even if India taxes the sale, the IRS expects you to report that gain and then use credits if applicable.

**For Indian property sales:** U.S. tax law also requires reporting gains from selling foreign real estate. If you sell real estate in India (land or a house/flat), any **capital gain** from the sale is subject to U.S. tax. You will calculate the gain in USD, using the original purchase price (plus improvements) and sale price converted to dollars on the respective dates. Note that India typically taxes property capital gains (long-term property gains are often taxed at 20% in India with indexation benefits for inflation). You must report the *unindexed* gain for U.S. purposes – the U.S. does **not** allow inflation indexation of basis like India does, so your U.S. taxable gain could be higher than the taxable gain calculated under Indian rules. The U.S. long-term capital gains tax rates (generally 15% or 20%) will apply if the property was held over a year. If the property was held short-term (sold within a year of purchase), the gain is taxed as ordinary income.

One potential benefit: if the Indian property was **your principal residence** for at least 2 of the 5 years before sale (which might be uncommon if you’ve been residing in the U.S. on H-1B), you could be eligible for the U.S. home sale exclusion (up to \$250,000 of gain tax-free, or \$500,000 if married filing jointly). This primary home exclusion applies regardless of the home’s location, as long as you meet the ownership and use tests. However, if you have been living in the U.S. and not occupying the Indian property, this exclusion likely won’t apply, and the full gain is taxable.

**Indian taxes on the sale:** When you sell property in India as an NRI (Non-Resident Indian), the buyer or Indian authorities may withhold a portion of the sale proceeds for tax. Any **capital gains tax paid in India** can be used to offset your U.S. tax, via the foreign tax credit (see next section). For instance, if you paid 20% tax in India on a long-term property gain, and your U.S. tax on that gain comes out to 15%, you could claim a credit for the Indian tax and potentially owe zero U.S. tax (since the foreign tax exceeds the U.S. tax). Conversely, if the U.S. tax is higher than India’s (say for a short-term gain), you’d claim credit for the Indian tax and pay the remaining difference to the IRS. The key point is **you report the gain in the U.S. and then use foreign tax credits to avoid double taxation**, rather than omitting the income. Keeping documentation like the Indian **sale agreement, proof of cost basis, and evidence of taxes paid in India** is very important. The IRS may ask for proof if you claim a foreign tax credit for the Indian taxes, so retain copies of the **Indian tax payment receipts or TDS certificates**.

Finally, note that **proceeds from a sale kept in an Indian bank account will count toward your foreign account reporting thresholds**. A large deposit from selling property or stocks could easily push your aggregate foreign balances over \$10,000, triggering FBAR/FATCA filing (covered next). Ensure you comply with those reporting requirements in the year of sale.

## Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR) and FATCA Compliance

In addition to reporting foreign income on your 1040, U.S. law imposes separate **foreign financial asset reporting requirements** on U.S. tax residents. As a resident alien, you are a “U.S. person” for these rules, meaning you must report **foreign bank accounts and assets** if certain value thresholds are exceeded. The two key reporting regimes are **FBAR** and **FATCA (Form 8938)**:

* **FBAR (FinCEN Form 114)** – The Foreign Bank Account Report is required if you have an interest in **one or more foreign financial accounts whose aggregate value exceeds \$10,000 at any time during the year**. This is a very low threshold (e.g. one account with \$10,001 at any point, or two accounts with \$5,000 each would trigger it). In your case, **if your Indian bank accounts total over \$10,000 at any point, you must file an FBAR**. This includes **bank savings accounts, fixed deposits, NRE/NRO accounts, foreign brokerage or demat accounts, etc.** You report the maximum value of each account during the calendar year. The FBAR is not filed with your tax return – it is an online form filed separately with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The annual FBAR deadline is April 15 (with an automatic extension to October 15). **No tax is due with an FBAR** – it’s purely an information report – but **penalties for failing to file can be severe**, so it’s crucial to comply if you meet the threshold. Even if an account only briefly went above \$10k due to, say, a property sale deposit, you must file for that year.

* **FATCA Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets)** – This is a form attached to your IRS tax return (Form 1040) if your **foreign financial assets** exceed certain higher thresholds. For U.S. residents filing **Single** (or Married Filing Separately), Form 8938 is required if total foreign assets exceed **\$50,000 on the last day of the year or \$75,000 at any time during the year**. For those filing **Married Filing Jointly**, the threshold roughly doubles – Form 8938 is needed if combined foreign assets exceed **\$100,000 on the last day of the year or \$150,000 at any time during the year**. “Specified foreign financial assets” include foreign bank and brokerage accounts, foreign stocks or bonds held directly, foreign mutual funds, cash-value insurance or pensions, and interests in foreign entities. (It **does not** include physical assets like real estate or jewelry, so your Indian property itself isn’t reported on 8938 – but if you hold sale proceeds or rental income in a foreign account, that account is reportable.) In practice, if your Indian financial assets are solely bank accounts and stocks in your name, and if their total value exceeds the thresholds above, you’ll attach Form 8938 to your 1040. On the form, you list details of each asset/account (account number, institution, interest amount, etc.). Note that Form 8938 **does not replace the FBAR** – you must file both if you meet both thresholds. Form 8938 has its own steep penalties (\$10,000+ for failure to file), so ensure you file it if required.

In **practical terms**, since you *may hold over \$10,000 in Indian accounts*, you should be prepared to file an FBAR annually. And if your assets grow (for example, if you accumulate significant investments or large property sale proceeds in India), keep an eye on the Form 8938 thresholds (which for a single filer are much higher at \$50k/75k). Filing jointly with your spouse allows a higher 8938 threshold, but remember that on a joint return **all** foreign assets either of you own are combined for reporting. Also, when you file your regular tax return, **don’t forget to answer the foreign account questions on Schedule B**. Schedule B Part III asks if you had any foreign bank account or trust, and which country it’s in. Always answer this accurately (for example, “Yes – accounts in India”). This alerts the IRS to your foreign accounts and should correlate with any FBAR/8938 filings.

**Summary of foreign asset reporting obligations:**

* *FBAR:* File if **aggregate** balance of **all** foreign accounts > \$10,000 (at any time in the year).
* *FATCA Form 8938:* Attach to 1040 if foreign financial assets > \$50k (single) or > \$100k (joint) at year-end (higher “any time” thresholds \$75k/\$150k).
* *Schedule B:* Must check “Yes” to foreign account and list country if you have any foreign account, even if the balance is low.

Both FBAR and Form 8938 are purely informational; you don’t pay tax with these forms. They exist to ensure U.S. taxpayers disclose foreign assets. Non-compliance carries heavy penalties, so include them in your annual tax routine if you meet the criteria.

*(Aside: If you hold certain types of foreign investments, additional forms may apply. For example, ownership in a foreign corporation might trigger Form 5471, foreign trusts require Form 3520/3520-A, and foreign mutual funds or ETFs can trigger the PFIC rules requiring Form 8621. These are beyond the scope of a simple summary, but be aware that significant overseas investments can come with extra reporting.)*

## Foreign Tax Credits for Taxes Paid to India

When you earn income in India as a U.S. tax resident, you’ll often face **double taxation** – India may tax that income because it’s sourced in India, and the U.S. taxes it because of your worldwide tax residency. Fortunately, the U.S. tax code (and the U.S.-India Tax Treaty) provides relief to avoid being taxed twice on the same income. **Foreign tax credits** (FTC) are the primary mechanism to mitigate double taxation. In general, if you paid income taxes to India on income that is also taxable in the U.S., you can **claim a credit for the Indian tax against your U.S. tax liability**.

Here’s how it works: Suppose you earned \$1,000 of interest in India and India withheld \$100 in taxes on it. You would report the \$1,000 as income on your U.S. return. The U.S. tax on that might be, say, \$240 (if you’re in a 24% bracket). You can then claim a **foreign tax credit** of \$100 for the Indian tax paid, reducing your U.S. tax on that interest. You’d ultimately pay \$140 net to the IRS, so that the interest isn’t taxed twice fully. The credit cannot exceed the U.S. tax on the same income, but you **get dollar-for-dollar credit up to that limit**. If foreign tax exceeds the U.S. tax, you generally won’t owe the IRS on that income, and you may carry over unused foreign tax credits to future years (up to 10 years). In our example, if India had taxed \$300 on that \$1,000 (30%), and U.S. tax was \$240, you could use \$240 of the foreign tax this year to wipe out U.S. tax on that income, and carry the extra \$60 forward to use in a future year’s credit (assuming the income falls under the same category for FTC purposes).

**Claiming the credit:** To claim foreign tax credits, you generally file **IRS Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit)** along with your 1040. Form 1116 segregates foreign-source income into categories (passive, general, etc.) and computes the allowable credit. You’ll input the amount of foreign taxes paid to India and the related income. Most types of income from India – interest, dividends, capital gains – fall under the “passive” income category or “general” category (depending on the nature and source). The form will calculate your credit based on the U.S. tax attributable to that foreign income. (There is a de minimis exception: if your foreign taxes are under \$300 single/\$600 joint and meet certain conditions, you may claim the credit directly on the 1040 without Form 1116. But often, with significant Indian income or large capital gains, Form 1116 is required.) Ensure you keep documentation of the foreign taxes (for example, Form 16A from India for TDS, or Indian tax returns) in case the IRS requests verification.

**Foreign Tax Credit vs. Deduction:** The U.S. allows a choice – you can either **take a credit** for foreign income taxes or **deduct** them as an itemized deduction on Schedule A. You can choose each year which route to take. However, **taking the credit is usually far more beneficial** in most cases. A **credit** directly reduces your U.S. tax **dollar-for-dollar**, whereas a deduction only lowers your taxable income (yielding a fractional benefit equal to your tax rate). Additionally, you can claim the standard deduction and still take foreign tax credits (credits don’t require itemizing), whereas to deduct foreign taxes you’d have to itemize (and the deduction could be limited by SALT caps if combined with state taxes). For these reasons, almost all taxpayers with foreign taxes opt for the **Foreign Tax Credit** to **eliminate double taxation**. The foreign tax credit is specifically designed to “relieve you of the double tax burden” when the same income is taxed by both the U.S. and a foreign country.

In practice, for income from India: you will report the gross income on your 1040, and then on Form 1116 claim a credit for any Indian tax paid on that income. The result is that you pay at least the higher of the two countries’ tax rates on that income, but not both. For example: interest income taxed 10% in India and (say) 24% in U.S. – you’d end up paying the 24% with credit for the 10% (so 14% net to IRS). Conversely, rental income taxed 30% in India and 22% in U.S. – you’d pay the 30% to India, and use that to offset the U.S. tax (owing zero to IRS, and possibly carrying over excess credit for the unused 8%). The **U.S.-India Tax Treaty** reinforces this by allowing foreign tax credits in each country for taxes paid to the other, and it may provide for reduced withholding rates on certain income (for example, treaty rates on dividends or interest), but the main mechanism you’ll use day-to-day is the foreign tax credit via Form 1116.

**Tip:** Be careful to claim the credit in the same year the foreign income is reported. If, for instance, you paid a large tax in India on a capital gain, make sure to include that in your U.S. foreign tax credit computation. Sometimes timing differences (cash vs accrual) can occur, but most individual taxpayers use the paid date. If you happen to pay Indian tax in a different year (e.g., you sell in December but pay the Indian tax in the next calendar year), you may need to file the credit in the year the tax was paid or accrued according to IRS rules. Consult the Form 1116 instructions in such cases.

Lastly, if for some reason you cannot claim a credit (e.g., the foreign tax is not an eligible income tax, or you have excess foreign tax credits you can’t use), you could choose to deduct the foreign taxes on Schedule A. But again, this is usually a second-best option. **In summary, taxes paid in India can almost always be credited against your U.S. taxes** to avoid double taxation. Taking the foreign tax credit by filing Form 1116 is the standard approach, and is **generally more advantageous than a deduction**.

## Long-Term Cross-Border Investment Considerations

Because you are a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) with significant financial ties to both the U.S. and India, it’s wise to plan your investments with both tax systems in mind. Here are some **key considerations for long-term planning**:

* **Ongoing Compliance:** Make annual compliance a part of your financial routine. Each year, you’ll need to report any Indian income on your U.S. returns and file FBAR/FATCA forms as required. Staying compliant is important not only to avoid penalties but also if you plan to later adjust your immigration status (e.g. applying for a green card or citizenship). U.S. immigration can ask about tax filing compliance. Since you intend to invest long-term in both countries, assume you’ll have dual reporting obligations for the foreseeable future. This requires diligence but also offers the benefit of global diversification once compliance is managed.

* **Investment Choices (PFIC Considerations):** Be mindful of the types of investments you hold in India. The U.S. has very punitive tax rules for **Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs)** – a category that includes most foreign mutual funds, certain foreign ETFs, and other pooled investments. If you invest in Indian mutual funds or ULIPs, for example, the U.S. will tax you under PFIC rules: gains can be taxed at the highest rate and interest charges applied, unless you make special elections. You’ll also have to file **Form 8621** for each PFIC investment annually. This can significantly complicate your taxes and reduce returns. As a long-term strategy, many U.S. tax residents avoid investing in foreign mutual funds and instead invest in equivalent assets through U.S.-based funds or direct stocks. **Directly holding Indian stocks or bank deposits** is simpler from a U.S. perspective (those aren’t PFICs; you’ll get taxed on dividends/gains in the normal way). If you do hold any PFIC-type assets, consult a cross-border tax advisor to consider elections like QEF or mark-to-market, and be prepared for extra compliance. In short, structure your portfolio to be tax-efficient in both countries – sometimes using U.S. investment vehicles for international exposure, and only keeping necessary investments in India.

* **Retirement and Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** The U.S. and India each have their own retirement savings vehicles (401(k), IRAs in the U.S.; PPF, EPF, NPS in India, etc.). As a U.S. resident, *Indian retirement accounts may not get the same tax deferral treatment* in the U.S. For example, **interest accrued in an Indian Public Provident Fund (PPF)**, while tax-free in India, is **taxable annually in the U.S.** (since the U.S. doesn’t recognize the PPF as a tax-exempt account). Keep this in mind for long-term planning: income accumulating tax-free in India might create yearly U.S. tax liability. If you intend to contribute to Indian retirement schemes or maintain them, factor in the U.S. tax drag. Conversely, U.S. retirement accounts (like a 401k) are not taxable in the U.S. until withdrawal, but if you later become an Indian resident, India may tax withdrawals (though the India-U.S. treaty may provide some relief). Coordinate your retirement planning with cross-border tax advice so you aren’t caught off guard by taxes when you access those funds.

* **Balancing Investments in Two Countries:** Think about where it’s best to earn different types of income. For instance, the U.S. has favorable long-term capital gains rates and no wealth tax, whereas India has no tax on long-term equity gains up to a point but does tax them at 10% beyond that, and has no tax on gifts from relatives (whereas the U.S. has gift/estate taxes for large transfers). If you plan to eventually **sell a large asset**, consider the timing and your residency at that time. Selling while you are a U.S. resident means U.S. capital gains tax (with foreign tax credit for Indian tax). If you were to wait and sell after relocating back to India (when you’re no longer a U.S. tax resident), the U.S. wouldn’t tax that sale – only India would. On the other hand, if you become an Indian resident again, India taxes global income too (if you are “Resident and Ordinarily Resident” in India). The **tax treaty** can help determine primary taxing rights and credits in either scenario. The takeaway is: align big financial moves (like property sales, business sales, etc.) with whichever residence will yield the better overall tax outcome, if you have flexibility on timing.

* **Currency Exchange and Records:** Over the long term, currencies fluctuate, which can affect your U.S. tax calculations on Indian investments. Always keep records of **the original purchase price in INR and the INR-USD exchange rate at that time**, as well as the rate at the time of sale or income receipt. The IRS requires using the exchange rate in effect when the income is received or the transaction occurs (or an average rate for periodic income). Proper documentation of these rates will ensure you correctly calculate gains and income in USD. Misestimating your basis or using the wrong FX rate could lead to overpaying tax or difficulties in an audit. Good recordkeeping is a key part of cross-border financial management.

* **Repatriation of Funds and Gifts:** If you plan to eventually bring money from India to the U.S. (say, after selling an asset or withdrawing investments), know that simply transferring your own after-tax money is not a taxable event in the U.S. – there is no remittance tax. However, large transfers **could trigger a reporting requirement** if they are treated as *foreign gifts*. For example, if family in India gifts you money that you then bring to the U.S., and the amount exceeds \$100,000, you would need to file **Form 3520** to report the receipt of a foreign gift. There is no tax on receiving a gift or inheritance from abroad, but the reporting is required. If the funds are genuinely your own earnings and savings that you’ve already reported, then Form 3520 wouldn’t apply (it’s only for gifts/bequests). Plan your transfers and maintain documentation to show the source of large inflows (e.g., sale proceeds, accumulated savings, etc.), so you can substantiate that it’s not unreported income or an unreported gift.

* **Dual Tax Residency and Expatriation:** If in the long run you obtain U.S. citizenship or a green card and later decide to return to India permanently, be aware of the **expatriation tax** rules. Long-term U.S. residents (including green card holders in at least 8 of the last 15 years) or U.S. citizens who renounce citizenship may be subject to a one-time “exit tax” on their worldwide assets if they meet certain net worth or tax liability thresholds. This can impact very wealthy individuals by treating all assets as sold on the day before expatriation for tax purposes. Most people below the thresholds won’t owe an exit tax, but it’s worth knowing about if your wealth grows substantially and you plan to give up U.S. residency. Additionally, during any period you might be considered a tax resident of both countries (for instance, the year you move back to India), the **U.S.-India tax treaty** has tie-breaker rules to determine which country gets to tax you as a resident. Typically, you won’t be fully taxed as resident by both at the same time – the treaty and foreign tax credits will prevent double taxation – but you may need to file dual or part-year returns. This is complex, so seek advice when the time comes.

* **State Tax Considerations:** Don’t forget state taxes if you live in a state that taxes income (e.g., New Jersey or New York, given your location). States generally also tax worldwide income if you are a resident of the state. They do not always offer foreign tax credits the way the federal system does. Some states have limited or no credits for foreign taxes, which means you might face double taxation at the state level. For example, New Jersey *does* allow a credit for income taxes paid to other countries, but many states do not. Check your state’s rules and plan accordingly. It might influence decisions like *which country to realize income in*, or even residency choices if state tax becomes burdensome on foreign income.

* **Professional Advice:** As a long-term plan, establish a relationship with a CPA or tax advisor experienced in **U.S.-India cross-border taxation**. The tax laws in both countries evolve, and things like treaty benefits, foreign account disclosure rules, and investment vehicles can change. Having expert guidance will help you optimize your investments (for example, using the treaty to reduce withholding on certain income, or navigating new compliance requirements). Given that you have significant ties to India, consider also consulting Indian tax professionals to ensure you meet Indian tax filing obligations as an NRI (for instance, filing a return in India if you want to claim a refund of TDS or if your Indian income exceeds the basic exemption there). Proper planning can minimize your global tax bill and avoid nasty surprises.

In summary, **investing in both the U.S. and India is certainly feasible, but it requires careful tax planning**. You’ll want to minimize dual taxation through credits and treaties, choose investments that don’t create undue tax headaches (beware of PFICs), and diligently comply with all reporting in both jurisdictions. By staying informed and proactive, you can enjoy the benefits of opportunities in both markets while remaining in good standing with the IRS and Indian tax authorities. Always prioritize compliance – report all worldwide income, file required forms like FBAR/8938, and claim your credits – so that your long-term financial growth isn’t derailed by avoidable penalties. With these strategies, you can successfully manage a long-term investment portfolio spanning the U.S. and India, optimizing taxes as much as possible under each country’s rules.
