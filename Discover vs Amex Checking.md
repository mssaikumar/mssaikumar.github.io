Thanks! I’ll compare Discover Cashback Debit vs. American Express Rewards Checking with a focus on long-term suitability. I’ll evaluate transfer speed (ACH, Zelle), reliability, sign-up bonuses and their churnability, account features, and any limitations or problems reported by long-term users.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a clear recommendation on which account would be better to keep for a lifetime.


# Discover Cashback Debit vs. American Express Rewards Checking

## Overview of Each Account

**Discover Cashback Debit:** An online checking account from Discover Bank that offers **1% cashback on debit card purchases**, up to \$3,000 in purchases each month (max \$30 cashback monthly, or \$360/year). It has **no monthly fees, no minimum balance**, and provides access to a large ATM network (60,000+ fee-free ATMs nationwide). Discover’s debit card is part of the Discover network, and the account includes features like free online bill pay and mobile check deposit. This account does **not pay interest on balances** – its main reward is the cashback on spending.

**American Express (Amex) Rewards Checking:** A relatively new checking account (launched 2022) for U.S. American Express consumer card members. It earns **Membership Rewards (MR) points** instead of cash back: **1 MR point per \$2 spent** on the debit card (equivalent to \~0.8% if points are valued at \~\$0.016 each). It also **earns interest on balances (around 1.00% APY)**, which is about 10× the national average for checking. There are **no monthly fees or minimums**. To open this account, you must have an Amex credit card open for at least 3 months. The debit card is an Amex-issued card (accepted at any ATM or merchant that accepts American Express); Amex provides **free ATM withdrawals** via **Allpoint and MoneyPass networks (70,000+ ATMs)**. However, like Discover, there are **no branch locations** for deposits (no cash deposits via ATM either). Early on, Amex’s checking lacked some features (no bill pay or Zelle at launch), but it has been gradually improving its services.

## Transfer Options: ACH & Zelle

**ACH Transfers:** Both accounts support free ACH transfers to and from external banks, but speed differs slightly:

* *Discover:* Outgoing ACH “push” transfers from Discover are **fast – often arriving next business day** at the destination bank. Incoming ACH “pull” transfers into Discover typically take **2–3 business days** to post, and Discover may hold first-time or large deposits for up to 10 business days for clearance. These are standard ACH timeframes. There are **no fees** for ACH, and users report being able to push up to \~\$15k in one day. (Discover’s ACH transfer limits aren’t heavily advertised, but no issues are noted for typical use.)

* *American Express:* Amex Rewards Checking is noted for **very fast ACH processing**. Many users report that outgoing ACH transfers from Amex arrive even **same-day or next-day**, and incoming pulls post within 1–2 days in many cases. Officially, Amex allows large ACH transactions (up to **\$25,000 per transaction/day** with a \$50k/5-day rolling limit) with no fees. In practice this means the account can serve as a “hub” for moving funds quickly. (Like Discover, standard ACH might still take 1–3 days depending on timing, but Amex seems to execute transfers promptly.) Both banks support **direct deposit** via ACH (e.g. payroll, government payments), and Amex even partners with a service (Pinwheel) to help switch direct deposits.

**Zelle Transfers (P2P payments):**

* *Discover:* **Supports Zelle**, but only after your account has been open **90 days** (a fraud-prevention measure for new customers). Once enabled, Zelle with Discover allows sending and receiving money to friends/family in minutes. **Daily send limit is \$600** for Discover Zelle payments. This is on the low end, suitable for small peer transfers. Zelle transfers are **free** and typically instant to enrolled recipients, just like at other banks.

* *American Express:* **Now supports Zelle** (integration was added after launch). There is **no waiting period** once your Rewards Checking is open and active – you can enroll in Zelle through the Amex mobile app and start sending/receiving. Transfers between enrolled Zelle users occur within minutes (though Amex notes some transactions could take up to 3 business days in certain cases). Amex has not publicly stated its Zelle send limits, but they are likely higher than Discover’s (many banks set daily Zelle limits in the \$1,000+ range). **No fees** to use Zelle with Amex. This addition closed a major gap Amex had at launch when Zelle wasn’t initially available.

**Internal Transfers & Other:** Both accounts allow instant transfers **between accounts at the same bank** (e.g. Amex Rewards Checking ↔ Amex Savings are instant and free; Discover Checking ↔ Discover Savings as well). Neither charges fees for standard electronic transfers. For large or same-day needs, **wire transfers** are available: Discover charges \$30 outgoing, Amex charges \$20 outgoing (with a high \$500k/day limit) – but these are optional since ACH/Zelle cover most needs. Overall, **both accounts are well-suited for electronic transfers**, with Amex having a slight edge in ACH speed and higher Zelle limits, and Discover working fine for typical ACH with the added caveat of a 90-day wait for Zelle.

## Customer Service & Reliability

**Customer Service:** Discover is known for **24/7 live customer support**, often praised for its helpfulness and U.S.-based reps. Discover Bank has a long history in online banking, and its support line for banking (1-800-347-7000) is available anytime. Customers generally report positive experiences resolving issues. American Express also has a strong reputation for customer service (especially on the credit card side) and offers phone support for banking (the Rewards Checking support line is 1-877-221-2639). Amex’s service is likewise 24/7 and responsive in dealing with account questions or problems. In short, **both companies are known for good support**, and you can expect reliable service from either for day-to-day needs.

**Reliability & Issues:** Discover’s Cashback Debit account has been around for many years (Discover relaunched it with cashback in 2022). Early after launch, Discover actually **halted new applications in mid-2022 due to high fraud activity**, as the CEO noted – fraud was “manageable” but it hurt service levels, so they paused sign-ups to improve controls. By early 2023 they resumed offering the account with stronger verification. Since then, there haven’t been unusual widespread issues; Discover Bank is FDIC-insured and regarded as a stable institution. Customer complaints specific to Discover Cashback Debit are relatively rare – most users find it reliable for direct deposits, withdrawals, and everyday use. One thing to be aware of is that Discover’s debit is on the Discover network, which isn’t as universally accepted as Visa/Mastercard. In practice, this only matters at a small number of merchants (the vast majority of U.S. retailers and ATMs accept Discover, so it’s a minor concern).

American Express Rewards Checking is newer, and it **initially launched without some basic features** (no bill-pay, no outgoing wires, no Zelle) which made it feel incomplete. Amex has since rolled out outgoing wires and Zelle support, and even enabled using the account to pay Amex credit card bills. This shows Amex is actively improving the product. However, as of 2024 many users noted it still **lacked a built-in bill payment system** for paying third-party bills – you can work around this by using your routing/account number on merchant or biller websites, but the convenience of scheduling bills in your banking app isn’t there yet. Also, **cash deposits** are effectively impossible (Amex has no branches and does not accept deposits via MoneyPass ATMs either). Checks can be deposited by mobile app or mail. These limitations aside, no major “reliability” issues (like account errors or lost funds) have been reported; it’s more about feature gaps. Because Amex requires you to be a cardholder to open, the user base is somewhat niche, but those who have it report that it works well for electronic transactions and the interface is clean. Amex is also FDIC-insured (through Amex National Bank) and has a solid reputation.

In summary, **Discover’s checking is a more mature product** with a long track record and fully-fledged features (making it very reliable for all standard banking tasks). **Amex’s checking is newer and gradually improving**, but still catching up on a few features (like bill pay). Both are backed by reputable institutions. If having every traditional feature is important from day one, Discover has the edge; Amex’s account is reliable for basic usage but you might need to rely on external methods for certain tasks (bill pay, cash deposit).

## Sign-Up Bonuses & Promotions

One big difference is in **promotional bonuses** for opening the account:

* **Discover Cashback Debit:** Discover Bank typically does ***not offer a cash sign-up bonus*** for opening a checking account. Instead, the ongoing 1% cashback on debit purchases is the main reward (effectively up to \$360/year back). In other words, Discover focuses on **long-term rewards** rather than upfront bonuses. There have occasionally been referral offers or package deals (and Discover often has bonuses on their savings accounts), but **no standard welcome bonus** for the checking. This means there isn’t an opportunity to “churn” Discover’s checking for bonus money – you gain value by using it over time. The upside is that you can open it whenever without worrying about missing a limited-time bonus.

* **Amex Rewards Checking:** American Express often runs **hefty welcome bonus offers** for new checking customers. For example, Amex has offered **\$200** or **\$250 cash bonuses** for opening a Rewards Checking and meeting certain direct deposit requirements. (One recent offer was \$250 for \$2,000 in payroll direct deposits within 90 days.) These bonuses are quite generous (>\$100) and have appeared as limited-time promotions a few times since launch. If you’re eligible and haven’t had the account before, it’s a great incentive to try it. **However, Amex generally limits these to one per customer.** The terms state you are **only eligible for one Welcome Bonus** – you won’t get it twice. In fact, you cannot even open more than one Rewards Checking at a time (one account per person). So “churning” Amex Rewards Checking repeatedly for multiple bonuses is not really possible. Once you’ve gotten a bonus, Amex will not give another if you close and reopen later. (They track prior account holders much like their credit card “once per lifetime” bonus rule.) It’s worth noting Amex also has *business* checking bonuses (for business accounts) that are separate, but for the personal Rewards Checking it’s one-time. All bonus payments are credited to the account after qualifying and are reported as interest (taxable) on a 1099-INT.

**Current & Historical Offers:** As of 2025, Amex’s bonus offers (when available) tend to be in the \$150–\$250 range, often around \$200+. Discover’s checking has **no history of large sign-up bonuses** – the “bonus” is essentially the cashback you earn by spending (e.g. “up to \$360” as some ads put it). So, if your goal is an upfront bonus, Amex is the one with that opportunity. Just plan accordingly since it’s a one-time deal.

## Using Each as a Long-Term Primary Checking Account

If you want to choose one account to use as your **primary checking for the long haul** (for things like paycheck direct deposits, bill payments, everyday spending, tax refunds, etc.), here’s how they stack up:

* **Direct Deposits:** Both accounts can handle direct deposits of payroll or government payments with no issue. Discover and Amex provide standard routing and account numbers (and both are recognized by major employers and the IRS for tax refunds). **Discover** supports “early ACH” on direct deposits – many customers report getting paid up to **2 days early** when their employer sends the file in advance. American Express hasn’t explicitly advertised early direct deposit, but users have noted sometimes getting credits a day early as well (likely because Amex processes ACH quickly). In general, you can trust either account to reliably receive your salary or IRS refund. One edge for Discover: they have an online direct deposit form and dedicated assistance, and since the account has been around longer, there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence of it working smoothly for all sorts of deposits. Amex uses a partner (Pinwheel) to help set up direct deposit or you can do it manually; it’s relatively new but there’s no negative feedback about it failing.

* **Bill Pay & Payments:** This is a significant point of difference. **Discover Cashback Debit offers a free online bill pay service** in its website/app. You can use Discover’s interface to send checks or electronic payments to payees (utilities, rent, etc.), making it convenient to manage bills directly from the account. **American Express Rewards Checking, on the other hand, still does *not* have a built-in bill-pay feature** in 2025 (beyond paying your Amex credit card). This means to pay bills from Amex, you’d need to initiate payments on the biller’s side (e.g. enter your Amex checking routing/account on your electric company’s website for ACH pull, or use third-party apps). While this workaround does enable bill payment, it’s not as seamless as having your bank send the payment. For someone who likes to handle all bills in one place, Discover provides a better experience right now. That said, lack of built-in bill pay isn’t a deal-breaker if you’re comfortable using alternatives, but it is an inconvenience of Amex as a primary account.

* **Debit Card Use:** Both accounts come with a debit card for purchases and ATM access. **Discover’s debit card** earns 1% cashback on up to \$3k of purchases monthly, so if you do use debit for a lot of transactions, you’ll consistently earn rewards (automatically credited). **Amex’s debit card** earns MR points (which can be redeemed for cash back into the account or transferred to travel partners if you also have an Amex credit card). The Amex debit’s effective reward rate is \~0.5% (less than Discover’s 1%), but if you highly value MR points for travel, it might appeal to you. As a primary account, you might not actually use the debit card heavily if you prefer credit cards for rewards (which many do – even the BI author admitted using credit for most spending). In that case, the debit rewards aren’t crucial, but note that **Discover’s cashback is a nice perk that doesn’t require any Amex-like point conversions** – it’s simple cash. Both cards have **no foreign transaction fees** (Discover explicitly has none on Cashback Debit, and Amex charges 0% on domestic, 2.7% on foreign transactions by card terms). If you travel abroad, Discover debit may be less widely accepted than Amex (Visa/MasterCard are more universal; Discover and Amex acceptance varies by country, but both are somewhat secondary networks internationally).

* **ATM Access & Cash:** As noted, **Discover offers 60,000+ fee-free ATMs** (through networks like Allpoint). **Amex offers 70,000+ ATMs** (Allpoint + MoneyPass) with no fees. In practical terms, both give excellent nationwide ATM coverage for withdrawals. Neither charges you a fee, though if you stray outside their networks, the ATM owner could charge a fee (and neither bank reimburses those, so you’d want to stick to the partner ATMs). **Cash Deposits:** Neither account is ideal for depositing cash. Discover doesn’t accept cash directly (no branches; some Allpoint ATMs allow deposit for certain banks, but Discover doesn’t support ATM deposits via that network as far as policy states). Amex explicitly does not support cash deposit at ATMs. So if you often need to deposit cash, a local bank or credit union might still be needed as a companion. For **mobile check deposits**, both have you covered through their apps. And you can always mail a check to either bank if needed (snail mail).

* **Checks & Bill Payments:** Discover will provide paper checks on request (free basic checkbook orders), and its online bill pay can send paper checks to payees for you. Amex allows you to **order physical checks** (likely for a fee) and of course you can write checks, but since they don’t have an integrated bill pay, you’d be writing/mailing checks manually or having the biller pull funds. If you write checks frequently, this is something to consider (Discover makes it a bit easier to automate, whereas with Amex you’ll handle it more yourself).

* **Interest on Balances:** A notable advantage of **Amex Rewards Checking is the interest (APY) it pays** on your balance. Currently \~1.0% APY, it means your money in checking earns some yield. This is higher than many regular checking accounts. **Discover’s checking pays no interest** on balances. So, if you tend to keep a large balance in your primary checking (for example, maintaining a cushion or accumulating money before moving to savings), Amex will at least pay you some interest on that. This can partially offset the lower debit reward rate. If you prefer to sweep most excess cash into a high-yield savings, then this difference is less important (Discover also offers a high-yield online savings you could pair with the checking).

* **Integration and Other Services:** Because Discover offers a full suite of banking products (savings, money market, CDs, etc.), the Cashback Debit integrates with those under one login. American Express now also offers a high-yield savings account, and if you have both Amex checking and savings, you can transfer between them instantly. Amex’s ecosystem is smaller (mostly credit cards, checking, savings), but if you’re an avid Amex credit card user, having your checking in the same app can be convenient for managing MR points and paying your card bills. Discover similarly integrates with Discover credit cards in their app if you have one, but it’s not required.

Overall, **Discover Cashback Debit is very well-suited as a long-term primary checking** – it has all the standard capabilities (direct deposit, online bill pay, mobile deposit, large ATM network, etc.) and no fees, making it easy to stick with for years. **American Express Rewards Checking**, while improving, still has a couple of omissions (no native bill pay, no cash deposit option) that might pose inconveniences for full-time use. It’s perfectly fine for a mostly electronic, branchless banking life – especially if you prioritize earning interest and maybe occasionally using the debit for points – but you may need workarounds for certain tasks.

## Recommendation: Which to Keep for the Long Haul?

Considering all factors, **Discover Cashback Debit is the stronger choice as a “lifetime” primary checking account** for most people. Its combination of reliability, comprehensive features, and straightforward rewards make it hard to beat for everyday banking. You’ll get consistent value (up to \$360/year in cashback) without changing your habits, and features like built-in bill pay, easy ACH transfers, and broad ATM access will cover all your needs. Discover has a proven track record and high customer satisfaction, which is important if you plan to entrust one account with your finances for the long run. In contrast, **American Express Rewards Checking is best utilized as a secondary or bonus-focused account** – it’s great to grab the generous **one-time sign-up bonus** if you’re eligible, and try out the service, but it’s not quite as feature-rich for primary use. You could open the Amex account when a **\$200–\$250 bonus** is on offer, meet the requirements, and enjoy the reward. After that, there isn’t much ongoing “extra” to justify switching all your banking to it (unless the 1% APY on checking balances is very attractive to you). In fact, because **Amex limits the welcome bonus to one per customer**, there’s little benefit in closing and reopening the account later – you won’t get a second bonus. So “churning” the Amex account repeatedly isn’t an option; it’s more of a one-time perk.

**Bottom line:** **Keep Discover Cashback Debit as your permanent checking hub** for direct deposits, paying bills, and everyday spending – it’s built to serve you well long-term with no fees and ongoing cashback. **Use American Express Rewards Checking opportunistically**, i.e. open it to take advantage of a lucrative sign-up bonus (and to earn some interest/points in the short term). You can maintain the Amex account as a secondary account if you find some niche use for it (like earning interest on extra cash or as an additional hub for transfers), but if it doesn’t add value beyond the bonus, you might close it once you’ve reaped that reward. In summary, **Discover is the more suitable account to “set and forget” for a lifetime**, whereas the Amex account is nice as a supplemental option to **earn a quick bonus** and maybe keep in the mix if its features align with your needs. Keeping Discover permanently and churning Amex (at least for the initial bonus) is a strategy that maximizes benefits while ensuring you have a robust primary checking in place for the long run.
