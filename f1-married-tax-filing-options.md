**Conclusion:** For an F-1 student from India with a non-working F-1/F-2 spouse, the **most cost-effective approach** is usually to **file as Married Filing Jointly as resident aliens** as soon as you can meet the requirements to do so. This approach leverages the larger standard deduction and access to credits (like the Child Tax Credit) to reduce taxes. Until that point, **filing separately as a nonresident with treaty benefits** is the way to go, which at least grants you a standard deduction and some relief. Each option has its legal prerequisites, but once youâ€™re eligible for the resident route, it tends to yield the lowest tax liability, especially when one spouse has no income. Always ensure compliance with IRS rules when making the joint election (attach the required statement to your return), and consider consulting a tax professional or IRS Pub. 519 for detailed guidance on the election procedure and any state tax implications. With careful planning, you can take advantage of the U.S.-India treaty in the early years and smoothly transition into the resident filing status at the optimal time to maximize your tax savings.
