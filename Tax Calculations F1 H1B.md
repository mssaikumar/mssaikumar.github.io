I will calculate your federal and New Jersey state taxes based on your mixed residency status for 2024: non-resident while on an F-1 visa until September 30th and a resident while on an H-1B visa from October 1st onward. Your total income is \$100,000, with \$70,000 earned under F-1 status and \$30,000 under H-1B.

I will consider the appropriate tax forms, rates, and any dual-status filing implications. I’ll get back to you with the calculations shortly.


# 2024 Federal and New Jersey Tax Breakdown for a Dual-Status Filer (F-1 to H-1B)

**Scenario:** A single taxpayer lived in New Jersey and had a *dual-status* tax year in 2024. From January 1 to September 30, they were a non-resident alien on an F-1 student visa (earning \$70,000). From October 1 to December 31, they became a resident alien on an H-1B visa (earning \$30,000). There are no tax treaty benefits, no itemized deductions, and no other income. Below is a breakdown of the federal and state tax liabilities, considerations for dual-status filing, and the required tax forms.

## Federal Income Tax Liability (2024)

Because of the dual-status situation, the year’s federal income is taxed in two parts – the nonresident portion and the resident portion:

* **Nonresident Period (Jan 1 – Sept 30, F-1 visa, \$70,000):** As a nonresident alien during this part of the year, the taxpayer is taxed **only on U.S.-source income** (the \$70,000 earned in the U.S.). This income is **effectively connected** with a U.S. trade or business (wages from work) and is taxed at the same *graduated rates* as for U.S. citizens/residents. Importantly, dual-status aliens **cannot take the standard deduction** for the nonresident period (and no tax treaty exemptions apply here). Thus, the entire \$70,000 is taxable. Using 2024 federal tax brackets for a single filer, the tax on \$70,000 comes out to roughly **\$10,450**. (This is calculated at 10% on approximately the first \$11,600, 12% on the next \$35,550, and 22% on the remaining income up to \$70k.)

* **Resident Period (Oct 1 – Dec 31, H-1B visa, \$30,000):** During this part, the individual is a U.S. resident for tax purposes, so they are taxed on **worldwide income** (in this case, only the \$30,000 U.S. income). Normally a full-year resident could claim the standard deduction (\$14,600 for 2024), but **dual-status filers are not allowed to use the standard deduction**. With no itemized deductions given, the entire \$30,000 is taxable. Using the tax brackets, \$30k of income falls into the 10% and 12% brackets. The tax on this portion is roughly **\$3,370** (10% on the first \$11,600 and 12% on the rest up to \$30k).

* **Total Federal Income Tax:** The federal tax liabilities from each portion are *added together*. In this scenario, the **total 2024 federal income tax** comes to approximately **\$13,820** (the sum of about \$10,450 from the nonresident period and \$3,370 from the resident period). This is the overall federal tax due for the year under dual-status filing.

## New Jersey State Income Tax Liability (2024)

New Jersey taxes residents on **all income earned** during the year, regardless of federal residency status. Since the taxpayer **resided in New Jersey** for 2024, they are treated as a NJ resident for state tax purposes and must pay tax on the full \$100,000 of income (the combined earnings) on their NJ return. New Jersey’s income tax is progressive, with rates ranging from **1.4% up to 10.75%** for individuals, depending on income level. For a single filer with \$100,000 of taxable income, the **NJ state tax** is approximately **\$4,200**.

* *Calculation:* NJ applies 1.4% on the first \$20,000, 1.75% on the next portion up to \$35,000, higher rates on each subsequent bracket, etc., up to 6.37% on income over \$75,000. At \$100,000 income, the top marginal rate is 6.37%, and the total works out to roughly \$4.24k in tax. (If New Jersey allows a personal exemption for the taxpayer, that would slightly reduce the taxable income, but with “no deductions” assumed, we’ve calculated the tax on the full \$100k for simplicity.)

## Dual-Status Filing Considerations

Filing as a dual-status alien has special rules and considerations:

* **Definition:** A *dual-status taxpayer* is someone who is a nonresident alien for part of the year and a resident alien for part of the same year. In this case, the taxpayer was nonresident (F-1 visa period) then became a resident (H-1B period) in 2024.

* **Income Taxation Split:** During the nonresident portion of the year, the individual is taxed **only on U.S.-source income** (e.g. U.S. wages, which in this case was the \$70k). Foreign-sourced income (if any) earned while a nonresident is not taxed by the U.S. During the resident portion, the individual is taxed on **worldwide income**, the same as a U.S. citizen or full-year resident would be. (Here the person’s income was all from the U.S. job anyway.)

* **No Standard Deduction:** Dual-status filers **cannot take the standard deduction** on their federal return. This means taxable income is generally higher than it would be for a full-year resident who could use the standard deduction. (They may itemize deductions if they have any applicable ones, but in this scenario no deductions are used.)

* **No Joint or Head of Household Filing:** Dual-status taxpayers are typically restricted to filing as Single or Married Filing Separately. They **cannot use Head of Household or file a joint return** in a dual-status year (unless a special election is made with a citizen/resident spouse, which doesn’t apply here since the taxpayer is single). In this scenario, the taxpayer files as single.

* **Social Security/Medicare:** While not part of income tax liability, it’s worth noting that F-1 visa holders are generally exempt from Social Security and Medicare (FICA) withholding during their nonresident period. Once on H-1B (resident status), FICA taxes apply. This does not affect the income tax calculation but is a consideration for paycheck withholding differences during the year.

* **Dual-Status Year Choices:** In some cases, a dual-status individual who becomes a resident at year-end can elect to be treated as a **full-year resident** (for example, using the “First-Year Choice” or if married, making a joint return election) instead of dual-status. Such an election would allow the standard deduction and a single continuous tax calculation, but it also means all worldwide income for the entire year would be taxable. In this scenario, no such election is taken – we are treating the taxpayer strictly as dual-status, which generally is the default for someone who was an F-1 student then H-1B in the same year.

## Required Tax Forms and Filing Process

For a dual-status tax year, the taxpayer will have to file **specialized federal returns** and the usual state return:

* **Federal Tax Return (Dual-Status):** Because the individual was a **resident alien on the last day of 2024**, they will file **Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return)** as their main return. **Write “Dual-Status Return”** across the top of Form 1040 to denote this special status. This Form 1040 will report the income and tax for the resident portion of the year (Oct–Dec). **Attach a statement** to the 1040 that shows the income and tax calculation for the nonresident portion (Jan–Sept). The attachment is typically a **Form 1040NR** (Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return) filled out for the Jan–Sept period – write “Dual-Status Statement” at the top of this 1040NR attachment. Together, these forms account for the entire year. (Note: Dual-status returns cannot be e-filed; they must be mailed in paper form.)

* **State Tax Return (New Jersey):** The taxpayer will file a **NJ-1040** (New Jersey Resident Income Tax Return) for 2024, since they were a resident of New Jersey. All \$100,000 of income is reported on the NJ return. New Jersey does not have a dual-status concept – it taxes residents on all income for the year. If the taxpayer had only become a NJ resident partway through the year, they would file as a part-year resident, but in this case it appears they lived in NJ the entire year. The NJ-1040 form will compute the state tax (approximately \$4.2k as noted above).

* **Form 8843 (Statement for Exempt Individuals):** Because the taxpayer was on an F-1 visa (student) during part of the year, they were an “exempt individual” for the substantial presence test (which is why they were treated as a nonresident for that period). **Form 8843** is an informational statement that F-1 visa holders must file for each year they are nonresidents, even if they have income. In practice, the taxpayer should file Form 8843 for 2024 to cover the Jan–Sept period on F-1. This form is usually submitted along with the tax return (or by itself if no income tax return were required). It simply reports the visa type and the number of days in the U.S. to claim the exempt status for that period.

**Summary:** In a dual-status year, the taxpayer ends up effectively preparing **two federal tax computations** (one for the nonresident part, one for the resident part) and combining them. In our scenario, the **total federal income tax** comes to about **\$13.8k**, and the **New Jersey state tax** about **\$4.2k**. The taxpayer must file using the dual-status alien procedures (Form 1040 with a 1040NR statement) and also file a NJ resident tax return. This approach ensures the income earned under each status is taxed appropriately, given the restrictions and rules that apply to dual-status aliens in the year of transition. The result is a clear breakdown of tax liability for both federal and state purposes under the dual-status filing situation.
