Thanks! I’ll look into legal ways for someone on an H1B visa, with coding and tutoring skills, to earn extra income outside of their full-time role as a Dev Analyst at a financial institution. I’ll focus on opportunities that are fully compliant with H1B visa regulations, including both active and passive income options.

I’ll get back to you with a clear summary of what’s allowed, common paths others follow, and any recent updates or legal interpretations.


# Earning Side Income on an H‑1B Visa: Legal Options and Compliance

## H‑1B Work Restrictions: Active vs. Passive Income

* **Authorized Employment Only:** An H‑1B visa holder is legally **permitted to work only for the petitioning employer** and in the role specified in the H‑1B petition. Any **active work** (paid or unpaid) for any other entity or self-employment is considered **unauthorized employment** under immigration laws.
* **Passive Income is Generally Allowed:** Earning money from **passive investments or activities** that do not constitute “work” is usually permitted. Immigration attorneys note that **truly passive income** (e.g. returns on stocks or rental property) is **not viewed as unauthorized employment**, whereas actively providing a service or labor outside your H‑1B job is prohibited. The distinction often comes down to your **level of involvement**: if you **“work” to earn the income, it’s not allowed**; if the money is generated with **no active work on your part**, it’s generally acceptable. For example, buying and holding a few stocks is fine, but **day-trading stocks full-time** could be seen as working as a trader, which **risks violating H‑1B rules**.
* **USCIS’s View on Unauthorized Work:** U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not issued very clear rules defining every scenario, so many side gigs fall into **gray areas**. In general, any activity that **could be a job for a U.S. worker** or involves **regular productive labor** is likely to be considered unauthorized employment. Immigration experts advise H‑1B holders to **err on the side of caution** – if in doubt, treat it as **not allowed** unless it’s purely passive. Violating these rules can lead to **status revocation** and other serious consequences if discovered.

## Passive Income Opportunities (Investments, Royalties, Real Estate)

H‑1B professionals can pursue **passive income streams** that do not require performing active work. Below are some **legally permitted passive income options** and important guidelines:

* **Investment Income (Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, Crypto):** Investing personal funds in the stock market, cryptocurrencies, or other securities is **allowed** as long as it remains a **passive activity**. You can buy, hold, or sell stocks for capital gains or dividends without issue. **Tip:** Avoid behaving like a professional trader (e.g. **day trading at high frequency** or making it a business), as USCIS could view that as active work rather than a hobby. In one attorney’s example, **casual stock investing is fine**, but executing “dozens of trades per day” might be seen as working as a trader. Similarly, earning interest from savings accounts, bonds, or CDs is passive and legal. Always **report investment income on your taxes**, but you do not need special work authorization to earn it.
* **Rental Income from Real Estate:** Renting out property you own can produce passive income that is **generally permissible** for H‑1B holders. For instance, if you own a house or condo, you may **rent out a room or lease the property** and collect rent. This is considered passive **“investment income” (like any landlord) as long as you are not actively running a rental business**. **Key guidelines:** Keep your involvement minimal – hiring a property manager or only occasionally renting (such as via Airbnb on an occasional basis) is wise. **Managing multiple properties or personally doing extensive landlord duties on a regular basis could cross into active work**. An immigration attorney notes that renting out one’s home **occasionally** is fine, but **operating numerous Airbnb rentals or a full-fledged realty business would be viewed as productive employment, which is not allowed**. Always declare rental income to stay in compliance with tax laws, and avoid roles like routine maintenance or concierge services yourself (those tasks can be contracted out).
* **Royalties from Intellectual Property:** Royalties earned from **books, articles, music, software, or patents** can be legal passive income, **depending on when and how the creative work was produced**. If you created the work **outside the U.S. or before you held H‑1B status**, any royalties paid to you (e.g. book royalties or licensing fees) are typically considered passive income – you’re getting paid for past intellectual effort, not for actively working now. However, if you **create new content while in the U.S. on H‑1B and earn royalties from it**, this can be problematic. A university’s guidelines explain that if an H‑1B employee authors material **for pay while in the U.S. for an entity other than their employer, the royalties would stem from unauthorized work**. In plain terms, writing a book or coding an app **during your H‑1B stay** and selling it for profit is viewed as self-employment. **Example:** Immigration experts have said monetizing a new YouTube channel or blog **created in the U.S.** could be seen as unauthorized employment, whereas revenue from content you made **before coming to the U.S.** and simply continue to receive ad royalties on might be considered passive. **Bottom line:** Royalties are safest when tied to **old or foreign-created work**. Creating new side projects for profit while on H‑1B is risky without additional work authorization.
* **Dividends and Business Profit Distributions:** If you **invest in a business (as a silent partner)** or own shares in a corporation, you may receive **dividends or profit distributions**. These are typically allowed as long as they truly derive from a **passive ownership** stake. **Important:** You must not actively operate the business (see the entrepreneurship section below). But merely **earning dividends as a shareholder** – just like receiving stock dividends – is fine. For example, some H‑1B professionals become **angel investors** in startups or buy into companies; they can legally earn returns on their investment as long as they **do not perform any work or management for those businesses**.
* **Other Truly Passive Sources:** There are a few additional income sources that don’t involve “working” and thus won’t violate H‑1B status. These include:

  * **Interest and Bank Bonuses:** Interest from bank accounts or **sign-up bonuses** that banks pay for opening accounts are classified as interest income (passive). For instance, some H‑1B holders take advantage of bank promotions (meeting certain deposit requirements) to earn a cash bonus – this is legal extra income since it’s essentially a form of interest.
  * **Gifts or Inheritances:** You can receive monetary **gifts** from family or friends. U.S. law allows anyone (U.S. or foreign) to receive cash gifts up to an annual exclusion limit (e.g. \$15,000) without tax implications. Gifts are not “income” from work, so they don’t affect immigration status (just ensure any large foreign gifts are properly reported to IRS on Form 3520 if required).
  * **Prizes and Gambling Winnings:** **One-time windfalls** like lottery or casino winnings or prizes from contests are generally allowed. Gambling is not considered employment – an H‑1B visa holder can legally gamble (where it’s lawful) and keep winnings. Similarly, if you were to win a prize from a contest or hackathon that is open to the public, it’s usually treated as a prize, not paid work. (However, be cautious with contests that look like paid gigs in disguise.) Any significant winnings should be reported on your taxes, but you do not need work authorization to **win money by chance or competition**.

**Compliance Tip:** Keep clear records that your passive income activities are indeed *passive*. If you own property or a business, document any third-party management and avoid taking on what could be seen as a job role. In case of any review, you want to demonstrate you did **not engage in unauthorized work** while earning that income.

## Tutoring and Teaching on an H‑1B

Many H‑1B holders with expertise consider tutoring or teaching as a side activity. **Unfortunately, most traditional tutoring for pay is not allowed** without work authorization, but there are a few legal avenues to explore:

* **No Paid Tutoring Without Authorization:** Under H‑1B rules, you **cannot be paid for tutoring or teaching** outside of your petitioning employer unless you obtain separate work authorization. Even if it’s a few hours on weekends, **receiving compensation for tutoring a student or teaching a class is considered employment**, which is tied strictly to your H‑1B sponsor. For example, being an online tutor on a platform, getting paid per session or per answer, would **violate your status** – this is essentially freelance work (prohibited for H‑1B). The same goes for in-person private tutoring for money.
* **Volunteer Tutoring – Allowed Only in Limited Settings:** What about **tutoring for free?** Unpaid volunteering is only permissible if it’s truly volunteer work in a role **where **no one would normally be paid****. U.S. law prevents foreign workers from “volunteering” in roles that are usually paid jobs, as that undercuts American workers. **This means you can’t bypass the rules by tutoring without pay** if normally tutors get paid for that work. For instance, you cannot volunteer as a math tutor for a private tutoring company or individual who would otherwise hire a paid tutor – that’s not allowed. However, you **may volunteer with an organization (generally non-profit)** where tutoring is an altruistic service and no wages are expected for anyone in that role. Examples might include helping out at a local community center, library, or school program that uses volunteer mentors. **Key point:** The volunteer position must be one that is **unpaid for everyone** and not a normally compensated job. If that’s the case, you can donate your time without violating H‑1B rules, but you absolutely **cannot receive any gifts, stipends, or in-kind compensation** in exchange.
* **Teaching or Tutoring via Concurrent H‑1B:** If you have a valuable skill (e.g. coding) that you want to teach for money, one **legal workaround is to obtain a concurrent H‑1B for a second employer** who offers that teaching job. “Concurrent H‑1B” means a separate part-time H‑1B petition, filed by the educational institution or company that wants to hire you as a tutor/lecturer, **in addition to your main H‑1B job**. U.S. regulations allow H‑1B holders to work for multiple employers **as long as each job has its own H‑1B approval**. For example, if a community college wants you to teach an evening coding course, they can file an H‑1B petition for you marked as “new concurrent employment” (perhaps for 5–10 hours per week). Once approved (or even upon filing, under H‑1B portability rules), you can legally work there in addition to your full-time H‑1B job. Many H‑1B professionals have taken this route to do side gigs in academia or consulting. **Note:** The second job must qualify as an H‑1B job (specialty occupation, prevailing wage, etc.), and your original employer doesn’t need to be notified by law (though check any company policies or non-compete agreements). According to immigration attorneys, **this concurrent H‑1B is the only viable way to be paid for a side job like tutoring** – otherwise, you are restricted to your single employer.
* **Online Courses or Royalties for Teaching Material:** If you are interested in **sharing knowledge for income**, another angle is creating an online course, book, or other content and earning royalties rather than wages. As discussed, this is a gray area – if you create the course **while on H‑1B in the U.S.** and put it on a platform like Udemy or Skillshare for profit, you are essentially working (developing educational content) without authorization. Some platforms might issue earnings as “royalties” for use of your content. If those truly count as royalties and the content creation wasn’t considered employment, it *might* be arguable as passive income. For example, if you had already written a complete coding tutorial book abroad and now sell it online, the royalty from each sale is passive. But if you’re actively recording lessons or writing chapters in the U.S. during off-hours for the purpose of selling, that is **active work, regardless of how the payment is labeled**. There have been **no explicit USCIS rulings on these specific scenarios**; therefore, most attorneys recommend caution. **Practical tip:** If you want to explore this, consult an immigration lawyer about structuring it (they may advise waiting until you have a green card or other work authorization to monetize such projects).

## Coding-Related Side Income (Freelancing, Open Source, Sponsorships)

As a software developer or tech professional, you might think about using your coding skills for extra income on the side. **It’s critical to recognize that almost all forms of active tech work for money outside your H‑1B job are off-limits**, with a few exceptions or workarounds:

* **Freelance Programming or Consulting:** Taking on any **freelance coding gigs** (contract work, bug bounties, coding competitions with guaranteed pay, etc.) is **not allowed** on H‑1B. This includes side jobs on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr, or building apps for clients as an independent contractor. Immigration law views this as **self-employment or employment by a third party** without authorization. One attorney plainly states: an H‑1B holder **“cannot work as a self-employed or freelance”** individual; any such work for pay is **unlawful without proper authorization**. Even short-term or one-off contracts require authorization. The only way to do side consulting legally is if the contracting company is willing to **sponsor you concurrently on H‑1B** (similar to the tutoring scenario above). For instance, if you want to do occasional consulting for a startup, that startup must file a concurrent H‑1B petition for you – **you cannot just 1099 as an independent contractor**.
* **Open Source Contributions and Developer Donations:** Many developers contribute to open-source projects and sometimes receive **grants or donations** (e.g. via GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, or Patreon). **If you are receiving money in exchange for coding work, even on open source, it could be viewed as employment**. The tricky part is that donations might be seen as a gray area – are they truly unsolicited gifts, or compensation for your software maintenance? Most likely, **regular payments from GitHub Sponsors would be treated as income for services** (since sponsors generally support you because you keep coding). This resembles contract work or self-employment, which is not allowed on H‑1B. There isn’t a specific law about “GitHub sponsorship,” but immigration experts have compared it to similar scenarios: if it’s paid via a 1099 form as a contractor would be, it’s a red flag. **Bottom line:** Proceed with extreme caution. Accepting a one-time unsolicited gift for your open-source project might slip under the radar, but setting up a recurring donation channel where you’re essentially **paid to code** outside your job could jeopardize your status. If the open-source work is truly a hobby and you’d do it regardless of pay, some H‑1B holders opt to decline any monetary sponsorship to stay safe.
* **Hackathon Prizes or Coding Contest Awards:** If you engage in coding competitions purely for prizes (no guaranteed payment, only if you win), this can be akin to winning a contest, not employment. For example, participating in a weekend hackathon where the **winners get a cash prize** is usually fine – this is comparable to a cash prize in a competition or even a bit like gambling winnings. **There is no employer-employee relationship in a prize scenario.** However, one should ensure the event is indeed a competition open to all and not a thinly veiled paid gig. **Tip:** Occasional contest prizes are generally safe to accept, but don’t treat competitions as a steady income strategy on H‑1B. Each contest should stand on its own as a one-off award.
* **Monetizing Personal Projects or Apps:** If you have personal coding projects (like a mobile app, a game, or a website) that you’d like to monetize, this falls into a gray zone similar to royalties. If the app was entirely developed outside the U.S. or before your H‑1B and now you just passively earn ad revenue or sales, it could be argued as passive income. However, if you are continuously developing or updating it while in the U.S., and earning money from it (via ads, in-app purchases, etc.), that is active work – you’re essentially running a side business. Many H‑1B holders delay monetizing their side projects or have a U.S. citizen co-founder handle the revenue side until they themselves get a work permit. **Workaround:** One legal approach if the project is significant – form a company and have it sponsor you (or another person) for an H‑1B to work on the project, i.e. convert it into a concurrent employment situation. This is obviously a complex route and typically only worth it for a serious startup, not a minor app.

**Keep in Mind:** The tech community often discusses these side gigs, and some people take risks in the gray areas. However, immigration lawyers consistently warn not to jeopardize your future for a small side income. If it involves writing code or using your specialized skills for pay, assume it’s **not allowed unless you have an H‑1B for it**. When in doubt, **talk to an immigration attorney** before accepting money for any coding work outside your main job.

## Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship

H‑1B visa holders are allowed to **start or own a business in the U.S.**, but they must remain **passive investors** unless they obtain work authorization through that business. Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering a side business:

* **Passive Business Ownership is Permitted:** Simply **investing in or owning part of a company** does not violate H‑1B rules. You can, for example, form an LLC with friends or invest in a startup as a shareholder. The critical restriction is that you **cannot perform work or daily management for that company** without authorization. Immigration law forbids H‑1B holders from engaging in active management of any business other than their sponsoring employer. In practical terms, you can be listed as an **owner, receive your share of profits**, attend board meetings, and vote on high-level decisions, but you **should not be running operations** or doing any hands-on tasks for the company. For instance, you can invest in a franchise and earn a cut of profits, but you cannot work as the store manager or even as a regular staff member there.
* **No Active Role or Employment in the Business:** **Any work you do for your own company is still “work” in the U.S.** and needs authorization. H‑1B holders must avoid **day-to-day roles** like managing employees, serving as the chief developer, making sales calls, etc., in their side business. One law firm emphasizes that even seemingly minor tasks — e.g. **writing a check to pay a business vendor** — could be deemed unauthorized employment if you perform them for your company while on H‑1B. The safest course is to be a **silent partner**: let others handle the labor. If the business is small, you might hire a manager or have a co-founder (ideally a U.S. citizen or someone with work authorization) run the operations. Your role would be limited to providing capital and perhaps very high-level guidance as an owner (without formal employment duties).
* **Receiving Profits Legally:** You are allowed to **receive your share of profits, dividends, or capital gains** from the business as an owner. This is like receiving a return on any investment. Just ensure it’s characterized as an owner distribution, **not a salary or contractor payment**. For example, if you own 20% of an LLC, you can take 20% of the distributed profits at year-end. That’s passive income. You should *not*, however, be on the company’s payroll or receive regular “payments” for services. Structuring any payouts as **investor returns** (and paying taxes accordingly) keeps it on the right side of the law.
* **Starting a Company with Intent to Work There:** If your goal is to actually **work for the business you start**, one approach is to have the company **sponsor you for an H‑1B** (either transferring from your current employer or concurrently). USCIS does allow this, but you must carefully structure the company to show a valid employer-employee relationship. Essentially, the company needs to be able to **supervise and if necessary fire you** for it to sponsor you – which means you should not own 100% or have sole control. Often this involves bringing in a partner or board of directors that has the authority to oversee your role. Many H‑1B entrepreneurs have done this: for example, **one H‑1B holder owned 45% of a tech startup and set up a board where others could fire him, allowing the startup to successfully sponsor his H‑1B** as a CEO. On the other hand, if you’re a sole proprietor or majority owner who answers to no one, USCIS will likely deny an H‑1B petition from your company because there’s no true “employment” relationship. In short, **you can found a business and even be employed by it, but only if you take the proper legal steps to have that business petition for a concurrent or transfer H‑1B and establish independent governance**. This is a complex process requiring an attorney’s guidance.
* **Passive Investment in Multiple Businesses:** Outside of starting your own, you can also invest in other businesses (venture capital, real estate partnerships, etc.) as a limited partner or passive investor. As long as you are **not “materially participating”** in the business, this is allowed. In fact, H‑1B holders often invest in startups or funds simply to grow their wealth, which is fine. Just be mindful that if any of those ventures ask you to take on a role (like an advisor or contractor work), you’d need to decline or ensure a concurrent H‑1B covers it.

## Concurrent H‑1B Employment (Legal Side Jobs)

One of the **only ways to actively earn extra income** (aside from passive streams) on H‑1B is to use the **concurrent H‑1B** mechanism. This means having **more than one H‑1B job at the same time**, each with USCIS approval. Here’s how it works and what to consider:

* **Multiple H‑1Bs Are Allowed:** U.S. immigration regulations permit an individual to hold **simultaneous H‑1B positions** with different employers. There is no limit (aside from practical time constraints) on how many H‑1B jobs you can have, as long as **each employer has filed a petition for you**. If you have a full-time H‑1B with Employer A, and you find a side opportunity with Employer B, Employer B can file an H‑1B petition marked “new concurrent employment” specifically for this part-time role. Once that petition is filed (and especially after approval), you can legally **work for Employer B within the parameters of that petition** while continuing your job with Employer A. All the standard H‑1B requirements (specialty occupation, wage, etc.) apply to the new role as well.
* **Part-Time or Full-Time:** The concurrent job can be **part-time**, which is common for side gigs. H‑1B law even allows two full-time H‑1Bs, though in reality you’d be subject to overtime rules and practical limits. Most side H‑1Bs are for part-time work – for example, 5-20 hours per week. Attorneys note that yes, an H‑1B worker **can hold two part-time positions concurrently** without issue. The hours per week should be specified in the LCA and petition. Anything under 35 hours is typically considered part-time for H‑1B purposes. Make sure you **don’t over-commit beyond what’s feasible**; you must still perform the duties of each H‑1B role as described in the petitions.
* **Concurrent Cap Exemption:** If one of the employers is a **cap-exempt organization** (like a university, nonprofit research institution, or government research lab), you could start that H‑1B at any time without worrying about the H‑1B cap lottery. If both are private companies (cap-subject), the good news is that since you already have H‑1B status, the second employer’s petition is **not subject to the lottery** – you’ve already been counted against the cap within the last 6 years. They can file a new H‑1B for you at any time of year. (Do note that if you never had a cap-subject H‑1B before – say your current H‑1B is cap-exempt – then a concurrent cap-subject would need to go through the lottery unless it qualifies as cap-exempt as well.)
* **Employer Awareness and Logistics:** Legally, you do **not need permission from Employer A** to take a second H‑1B job, and Employer B doesn’t need permission from A either. They are separate legal matters. That said, **check your employment contract** at your primary job – some companies have moonlighting policies or non-compete clauses. Make sure your side job doesn’t violate those. Also consider the **time commitment** and that you continue to meet performance expectations at your main job (to avoid losing your primary H‑1B). If Employer A were to terminate you, the concurrent H‑1B could potentially keep you in status (if it was already approved and active) but only as long as you work for Employer B; you’d need to quickly ramp that up or find another solution to maintain valid status. It’s safest to use concurrent H‑1Bs for supplemental income, not as a backup for job loss (unless the secondary job can become full-time).
* **Examples of Concurrent H‑1B Use:** Many H‑1B holders have successfully **taken on side roles** via concurrent H‑1B:

  * An H‑1B **software engineer** in industry teaching one course per semester at a university (with the university sponsoring a concurrent H‑1B).
  * An H‑1B **financial analyst** doing part-time consulting for a second firm, with that firm filing an H‑1B petition for 10 hours/week of services.
  * An H‑1B **researcher** at a company working weekends at a startup that also obtained an H‑1B for her.
    In all these cases, because each employer had authorization for the worker, the income from the second job was **fully legal**. Immigration lawyers emphasize this is the **only clear way to actively earn extra employment income** on H‑1B without breaking the law.

## Tips for Compliance and Real-World Insights

To wrap up, here are some **practical tips and examples** to help you stay on the right side of regulations while seeking extra income on an H‑1B:

* **When in Doubt, Consult an Expert:** If you have a specific side hustle in mind and you’re not 100% sure it’s allowed, **consult an immigration attorney before proceeding**. The rules can be nuanced, and an attorney can give personalized advice. As one law firm advises, given the high stakes (your legal status), it’s worth getting professional guidance to ensure you don’t inadvertently engage in unauthorized work. A quick paid consult is better than risking your visa over a misunderstanding.
* **Maintain Proper Tax Reporting:** For any income you do earn (even passive), make sure to **report it on your tax returns** and in the correct category (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.). **Do not attempt to hide income from the IRS**. USCIS has the authority to review tax records and will see if, for example, you have a 1099 for freelance work. If they discover undeclared side earnings that look like employment, it can lead to visa problems. Paying taxes on passive income also helps demonstrate you’re law-abiding. Remember, **authorized passive income is taxable** – there’s no immigration issue in reporting it. The issue is doing unauthorized work in the first place.
* **Keep Your Day Job Secure:** Ensure that any side activity, even if legal, **does not jeopardize your primary H‑1B employment**. Your main job must continue to meet H‑1B conditions (full-time hours if full-time, appropriate salary, etc.). Don’t let a side gig consume so much time or energy that your performance slips at your H‑1B job. If you lose the main job, you generally have a 60-day grace period to find new employment or leave the country, unless you already had another concurrent H‑1B running. Always prioritize maintaining your **status and good standing** with your primary employer.
* **Examples of Safe Side Incomes:** Thousands of H‑1B visa holders boost their earnings through **safe channels**. Common examples in the community include investing in index funds and stocks (many set aside part of their paycheck for this), buying a rental condo and using a property manager to handle tenants, or casually renting out their car on a car-sharing app occasionally. These activities have been done by H‑1B workers **without issue, as they are passive**. Another example: some H‑1B professionals carpool and get gas reimbursement via apps like Waze Carpool – since it’s just sharing costs (not making profit as a driver), it’s acceptable. The key in all these examples is that **the H‑1B holder is not “working” a second job; they’re leveraging assets and investments**.
* **Beware of Grey Areas (YouTube, Blogs, Apps):** A real-world scenario that often comes up is H‑1B holders wanting to monetize a hobby or talent, like starting a YouTube tech channel, a coding blog with ads, or a mobile game for sale. As discussed, if you’re creating new content while in the U.S. and earning revenue from it, immigration authorities **might view that as unauthorized work**. One H‑1B employee asked if he could monetize his YouTube channel: attorneys said if all the videos were made before he came to the U.S. and he’s just passively getting ad money now, it’s probably okay, but if he’s actively filming and uploading videos in the U.S. for profit, that’s risky. The same logic applies to coding projects. **Takeaway:** It’s best to postpone monetizing such ventures or do them purely for passion (no earnings) until you get a status with open work authorization (like a green card EAD).
* **Success via Concurrent Employment:** Many H‑1B holders have found that the most straightforward way to earn extra income doing what they love is to **line up a secondary employer and get a concurrent H‑1B**. It requires paperwork, but it is legally clean. For instance, an H‑1B software developer who was also a skilled musician got a second part-time H‑1B to perform as an instructor at a music school – turning his talent into income lawfully. If you have a marketable skill (tutoring, artistic, consulting, etc.), consider whether an organization would sponsor a part-time role for you. **Concurrent H‑1Bs are increasingly common** in today’s gig economy and provide a win-win: you get extra income and the employer gets your skills, all within the legal framework.
* **Stay Informed on Policy Changes:** Immigration rules can evolve. Stay updated on any changes in H‑1B policy that might affect employment restrictions. For example, there has been ongoing discussion about modernizing work authorization for certain visa holders. While no rule currently allows H‑1Bs to freelance freely, keep an eye on USCIS announcements or immigration news. As of 2025, the consensus among legal experts remains that **active side jobs are off-limits without concurrent H‑1B or an EAD**, and there’s no indication of that loosening yet. Knowing the latest policy interpretations (through reliable sources or attorney newsletters) will help you plan your finances and side ventures accordingly.

**Conclusion:** Earning extra income on an H‑1B visa is certainly possible, but it requires careful navigation of immigration laws. The general principle is to **avoid any unapproved employment** – stick to passive income streams or formal concurrent H‑1B arrangements for side work. By leveraging investments and being strategic (and lawful) about any side engagements, you can increase your earnings **while remaining fully compliant** with H‑1B regulations. Always put your visa status first – no side income is worth losing your permission to live and work in the U.S. With the right approach and possibly legal guidance, you can find ways to make additional money and still sleep soundly knowing you’re within the bounds of the law.
