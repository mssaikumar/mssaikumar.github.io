Treating Hair Loss with Hims: Minoxidil and Finasteride Insights

Understanding Male Pattern Hair Loss (AGA)

At age 28 with hair thinning at the front sides (receding hairline at both temples), you are likely experiencing androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness). This common condition is driven by genetics and hormones – specifically the hormone DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which gradually shrinks hair follicles at the hairline and crown ￼ ￼. A receding frontal hairline (as you described) is a typical pattern. Without treatment, this process is progressive. Once follicles completely miniaturize and stop producing hair, regrowing hair in those areas becomes very difficult ￼. The good news is that early intervention can slow or even halt this process. Two FDA-approved treatments – minoxidil and finasteride – have a strong track record for treating male hair loss by targeting the problem from different angles.

Minoxidil: A Topical Hair Growth Stimulator

Minoxidil is a well-known over-the-counter treatment (the active ingredient in Rogaine®) that you apply directly to the scalp. It works as a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels and increases blood flow to hair follicles, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to help them grow ￼. Minoxidil also prolongs the anagen (growth) phase of hair, so hairs stay rooted longer and can grow thicker. It’s available as a 5% topical solution or foam for men – you’ve probably seen Hims advertising their dropper solution and foam. You typically apply minoxidil twice daily to the thinning areas.

Effectiveness: Minoxidil is proven to help halt hair loss and stimulate new growth for many users. It tends to work best on areas with thinning hair (like the crown), but many men also apply it to a receding hairline with some benefit. In a large 1-year study of 984 men, 5% minoxidil stopped hair loss from progressing in the majority of users – investigators noted the balding areas got smaller or stayed the same in about 97% of participants ￼. Moreover, 84% of men had at least moderate hair regrowth after one year of use (only ~16% saw no improvement) ￼. Even in a shorter 4-month study, about 67% of men reported their balding area became smaller and 74% observed thicker hair density on minoxidil ￼. These numbers show that most people get some benefit – typically reduced shedding and modest regrowth – with diligent use. Keep in mind that results vary: minoxidil tends to maintain existing hair and regrow thinner, shorter “vellus” hairs at first. It may not fully restore areas that have been bald for a long time, but it can significantly improve overall thickness and slow further recession.

Usage and Expectations: Consistency is key – you’d need to apply it every day (usually morning and night). Many users notice less shedding and initial signs of improvement by about the 3rd or 4th month, with more visible results at 6+ months ￼. (In fact, about half of users in one study noticed reduced hair loss by the 2nd month ￼.) It’s normal to experience a shedding phase in the first 1-2 months of use – basically, weak hairs are shed to make way for new, stronger growth. This can be alarming but is usually temporary. For the best results, you have to stick with it for the long term (more on that below).

Side Effects: The good news is that topical minoxidil is generally very safe for most people ￼. Because it’s applied to the skin, very little absorbs systemically. The most common side effects are scalp irritation such as redness, dryness, or itching in the area of application. Studies show only about 2–4% of users have these minor skin side effects ￼. Hims notes that the propylene glycol in some minoxidil solutions (not in the foam formula) can cause irritation in sensitive individuals ￼. If you have had sensitive skin, their propylene-glycol-free foam might be a good option. Another possible side effect is unwanted hair growth on the face (e.g. a bit more facial hair) – this can happen if minoxidil drips down or if a tiny amount is absorbed into the bloodstream, but it’s not very common ￼. Systemic effects (like affecting blood pressure or heart rate) are rare at the low dose used on the scalp, since the original blood-pressure dose was much higher. Overall, minoxidil is well-tolerated by most, and any mild irritation can often be managed by switching formulations or using it once daily instead of twice, if needed.

Finasteride: A DHT-Blocking Pill

Image: Hims finasteride (1 mg) prescription tablets. Finasteride is an oral medication that inhibits the hormone (DHT) responsible for hair loss.

Finasteride (brand name Propecia® when used for hair) is a prescription pill taken once daily (1 mg dose for hair loss). It directly targets the hormonal cause of male pattern baldness. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, which means it blocks the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ￼ ￼. By lowering DHT levels (about a 60–70% reduction in scalp DHT) ￼, finasteride protects your hair follicles from the DHT-driven miniaturization process. Essentially, it prevents further damage to follicles, helping to halt ongoing hair loss and allow hairs to grow thicker and fuller. Finasteride is especially effective for preserving hair at the crown and mid-scalp, but it also helps slow a receding hairline – in fact, it’s the only medication shown to significantly slow hairline recession, since the hairline is particularly sensitive to DHT ￼. Starting finasteride earlier in the balding process is ideal, because once a follicle is completely gone, medication can’t resurrect it ￼.

Effectiveness: Finasteride is considered highly effective for the majority of men. In clinical trials, about 83% of men on finasteride had no further hair loss after 2 years, compared to 28% on placebo who stabilized (meaning finasteride dramatically outperforms doing nothing) ￼. Many men even experience regrowth: one review found finasteride 1 mg daily significantly increased hair count versus placebo by an average of ~12 hairs per square centimeter after 6 months, and ~16 hairs/cm² after 12 months ￼. This translates to visibly thicker hair coverage for most patients. Longer-term data is encouraging as well – a 5-year study reported that about 65% of men had visible improvement (hair loss stopped or reversed) on finasteride, while virtually all the others maintained the hair they had at baseline ￼. In other words, finasteride can halt or reverse hair loss in a clear majority of men with androgenetic alopecia. Some studies even report higher success rates – for example, a Korean 5-year study found ~85% of men improved on finasteride – but results can depend on how “improvement” is defined ￼. The consensus is that finasteride is extremely effective at keeping the hair you have and often thickening it. It may also regrow some of the recent losses (especially in the crown region). However, like minoxidil, it’s not a total cure – it likely won’t fully regrow a completely bald scalp or restore a dramatically receded hairline to its teenage state. Its main power is prevention of further loss, with some bonus regrowth.

Usage and Timeline: You take finasteride as a tiny pill (1 mg) once per day. Many Hims users take it in the morning or at night; the timing isn’t crucial, but consistency is. Because hair grows slowly, you should commit to at least 6–12 months of daily use to judge its effect. Most men start noticing reduced shedding or slight improvements in thickness by about 3–6 months, with more significant results by 12 months ￼. If you’ve been steadily losing hair, a sign it’s working can be that your hair loss slows down or stops. Some men even see regrowth at the hairline or crown over the first year – usually fine vellus hairs at first, which can thicken over time. If you see no improvement after a year, it may not be effective for you (a minority of men are non-responders), but often it’s doing something subtle like slowing the loss even if regrowth isn’t obvious.

Side Effects and Safety: Finasteride is generally safe for long-term use, but it does come with some important considerations. Because it alters hormone (DHT) levels, a small percentage of men experience sexual side effects. The most commonly reported are a decreased libido (lower sex drive) or erectile dysfunction (ED) ￼ ￼. In clinical trials, the incidence of these side effects was low – on the order of ~2% of men on finasteride, compared to ~1% on placebo, meaning only a slight increase over the placebo rate ￼. A large review in 2017 actually found an even lower rate (~0.7%) of sexual side effects in men taking 1 mg finasteride for hair loss ￼. Most men do not experience noticeable side effects. For those who do, the symptoms are usually mild and often reversible upon discontinuing the medication ￼ ￼. It’s worth noting that there have been reports of persistent sexual side effects in a very small subset of men even after stopping finasteride – a phenomenon termed “post-finasteride syndrome.” This is controversial and appears to be quite rare, but it has been documented ￼. The current medical view is that persistent effects happen in only a tiny fraction of users, but patients should be informed of the possibility ￼. Aside from sexual side effects, finasteride is well tolerated. There are some reports of mood changes (like anxiety or depression) in a few individuals, enough that the FDA added a warning about possible depression in 2011 ￼. Causation isn’t clear, but it’s something to be aware of and monitor. A very rare side effect is breast tenderness or enlargement (gynecomastia) due to hormonal changes ￼ – if one notices breast tissue changes, they should see a doctor. Importantly, women who are pregnant or may become pregnant must not handle finasteride pills (especially broken or crushed pills) because it can cause birth defects in male fetuses ￼. This is mostly a concern for your partner or household members: for example, if you have a spouse who could get pregnant, she shouldn’t touch the pills. As a male patient, this precaution doesn’t affect you beyond being careful.

Overall, for a young healthy man, finasteride is considered safe with a low incidence of side effects. Millions have used it since the 1990s. Doctors often advise trying it – if you happen to get side effects, you can stop and they usually subside. It’s wise that Hims (and any prescriber) asks about your medical history; in your case, having had tuberculosis at age 17 should not disqualify you. Finasteride isn’t known to interact with past TB infection. Just make sure you mention any medications you currently take or any liver issues (finasteride is metabolized by the liver, but normal liver function is fine). TB treatment at 17 likely involved antibiotics like isoniazid/rifampin, which you’re long done with, so they won’t conflict now. As always, be open about your health history in the questionnaire – the Hims doctor will review it and ensure it’s safe for you to use these meds.

Using Finasteride and Minoxidil Together

You mentioned Hims is advertising both minoxidil and finasteride – that’s for good reason. These two medications attack hair loss in complementary ways: finasteride reduces the hormone (DHT) attacking your follicles, and minoxidil directly stimulates the follicles to grow. Using them together is widely considered the most effective medical approach for male hair loss ￼ ￼. In fact, research shows that combining finasteride + minoxidil yields better results than using either one alone ￼. One meta-analysis concluded the combo led to significantly greater increases in hair density than either treatment by itself ￼. Practically, finasteride will preserve and thicken existing hair, while minoxidil will encourage new growth and help strengthen thin hairs. By doing both, you’re more likely to see visible improvement and not just stabilization.

Hims (like other providers) sometimes offers a “Hair Loss Duo” package for this combo – as noted in their info, it starts around $32 per month for both finasteride and minoxidil together on a subscription ￼. Many hair loss experts do recommend using both (assuming you tolerate them well) for at least a year to maximize your outcome ￼. If, for example, someone couldn’t tolerate finasteride (due to side effects), then minoxidil alone is certainly worth using, and vice versa. But if your goal is to do “whatever is best,” then using both medications as directed will give you the best shot at significant improvement. There is no strong contraindication to using them simultaneously – they work via different mechanisms and are considered safe to use together. In fact, Hims even sells a combined topical formula (finasteride + minoxidil in one solution) for convenience ￼ ￼. Whether you use a combo product or separate pill + topical, the end result is similar. Just be sure to be consistent and patient, as each works on its own timeline (finasteride might halt DHT effects relatively quickly, but hair grows slowly; minoxidil might spur new hairs, but those hairs take months to become visible). Using both, you might notice reduced shedding from finasteride in a few months and new baby hairs from minoxidil in 4-6 months. Over 6-12+ months, the combo can meaningfully thicken your hair and restore some of the density, especially if you start early like now ￼ ￼.

Expected Results: How Well Do These Treatments Work?

It’s important to set realistic expectations. Neither finasteride nor minoxidil is a magical instant cure – but they can produce very satisfying results if used properly. Based on clinical evidence and user experiences:
	•	Halting Further Loss: You can reasonably expect finasteride (with or without minoxidil) to stop or dramatically slow your ongoing hair loss. In studies, over 80–90% of men get this benefit – meaning they keep the hair they have, whereas without treatment they would have continued to lose more ￼. Many users report that within a few months, they notice much less hair in the shower drain or on the pillow, indicating shedding has decreased.
	•	Hair Regrowth: Regrowth is variable, but quite common. Typically, crown/thinning areas respond best – you might see thinning spots fill in thicker. The hairline (frontal) is more difficult to regrow once it has receded, but finasteride can sometimes rejuvenate miniaturized hairs at the hairline (hairs that had become almost invisible can thicken and lengthen again). Minoxidil can also spur some new small hairs along the hairline for some men, though not everyone. Clinical trials for finasteride showed significant improvements in hair count and coverage by 1 year ￼, and continued use maintained those gains at 2, 5, even 10 years in follow-ups. For minoxidil, about 60–70% of men see visible regrowth of some kind (from small fuzz to decent cosmetic improvement) over 6–12 months ￼ ￼. It’s rare to get full restoration of the hair you had as a teenager, but moderate regrowth is common. If your hair loss is at an early stage (sounds like maybe a Norwood 2-3 at the temples), you have a better chance of regrowth than someone who has a large bald spot. Your hairline may not move all the way forward again, but you could thicken up the areas just behind the hairline and possibly see some slight forward regrowth at the temples. Think of it like turning the clock back a couple of years on your hair loss – that’s often achievable.
	•	Timeline: Patience is crucial. Generally, by 3 months you might notice less shedding. By 6 months, some early regrowth or thickening can be visible (maybe tiny new hairs or a fuller look in photos). 12 months is often when people can clearly see the difference in before-and-after pictures. Improvements can continue up to ~18–24 months on treatment – after that, the medications’ effect plateaus, and your hair will likely stay at that improved level as long as you continue the meds. If you ever stop, you’ll lose the gains (more on that below). It can be helpful to take photos every few months to track subtle changes that you might not notice day to day.
	•	Confidence and Appearance: Many users report feeling more confident as they see improvement. Even maintaining your current hair (preventing further recession) can be a big relief and boost self-esteem, as you stop feeling like you’re inexorably balding. And if you get regrowth, that’s icing on the cake. It’s important, however, to keep your expectations grounded. Some users who hoped for a full head of hair might feel let down if they only get modest thickening ￼. The key is that “improvement” can mean anything from no longer balding (stopping the loss), to a slight increase in density, to noticeable regrowth in thinning areas. All of those are wins, but if someone expects complete reversal of hair loss, they might be disappointed. In a study, investigators often rated patients’ results more optimistically than the patients rated themselves – suggesting that people tend to be very critical of their own hair ￼ ￼. So, celebrate the small wins (slower recession, small new hairs, thicker texture) and give it time.
	•	When treatments aren’t enough: If after 12–18 months you feel the results are not satisfying, there are other options like adding microneedling, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) caps, PRP injections, or ultimately hair transplant surgery for more dramatic restoration. But these are usually considered only if meds don’t give the desired outcome. Many men find that finasteride + minoxidil did enough that they can postpone or avoid surgical options for a long time.

Overall, with consistent use of finasteride and minoxidil, most men your age will see a meaningful improvement – at least stopping the hair loss and likely some regrowth/thickening. The treatments are considered successful if you still have more hair (or the same amount) after a year than you would have had without treatment ￼. Given that you’re feeling self-conscious now, preventing further loss is a huge benefit in itself. There’s a very good chance you’ll be happier with your hair in a year’s time if you start therapy now, compared to doing nothing.

Side Effects: Getting the Full Picture

It’s completely natural to worry about side effects – kudos to you for wanting to understand the risks. We’ve touched on these, but let’s summarize clearly:
	•	Finasteride Side Effects: The primary concerns are sexual side effects (low libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced ejaculation volume). These affected around 1–2% of men in clinical trials of finasteride, only slightly higher than placebo ￼. The vast majority (~98%) did not experience these issues. If side effects occur, they typically emerge within the first few months. Monitoring how you feel is important – if you notice changes in sexual function or mood, you can decide in consultation with your doctor whether to continue. Most often, any side effects reverse after stopping finasteride ￼. There have been rare reports of persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation (the controversial “post-finasteride syndrome”), but large analyses haven’t found a clear high incidence for this in hair loss patients ￼. It appears to be very uncommon, but not zero. Finasteride can also cause a slight drop in PSA levels (a blood marker related to the prostate), which is only relevant if you’re older and monitoring prostate health. Some men report brain fog or mood swings, though it’s hard to pin down how frequently this truly occurs – finasteride’s label includes a warning about possible depression in rare cases ￼. On the plus side, finasteride has some health benefits like reducing risk of prostate issues (it’s even used at higher doses to treat BPH). For a healthy 28-year-old, serious adverse effects are highly unlikely. The key is to be aware of your body: if you think you’re feeling side effects, talk to the Hims medical provider. Sometimes lowering the dose (like taking 1 mg every other day) or switching to topical finasteride can alleviate side effects while still helping the hair – some users do that if needed. Topical finasteride (which Hims also offers) aims to deliver the drug to the scalp with less systemic absorption, potentially reducing side effect risk ￼. This might be an option if you’re very concerned, though evidence suggests even oral finasteride at 1 mg has a low side effect rate.
	•	Minoxidil Side Effects: As noted, topical minoxidil’s side effects are mostly local skin reactions (itchy/flaky scalp) in a small percentage of users ￼. If you do get irritation, you can try the foam version (which lacks certain ingredients like propylene glycol) ￼ or use a corticosteroid lotion short-term to calm the skin (some doctors recommend that, or Hims might have a formula with minoxidil + a bit of hydrocortisone to reduce irritation). Another thing you might notice on minoxidil is increased hair shedding initially (usually in weeks 2–8). This can be unsettling, but it’s a known effect – minoxidil accelerates the shedding of weak hairs so that new hairs can grow. It’s temporary and usually a sign the medication is working as intended. Rare systemic effects (more likely with oral minoxidil, which some people take at low dose) include dizziness, fast heart rate, or ankle swelling – but these are extremely uncommon with the topical solution at proper use. If you apply it correctly (just on scalp, recommended 1 mL twice a day), systemic absorption is minimal. To be safe, don’t exceed the recommended dose, and wash hands after application to avoid spreading it to other skin. In summary, minoxidil is very safe, and any side effects are usually minor and manageable.
	•	Combined Use Considerations: Using finasteride and minoxidil together does not introduce new side effects beyond those of each individual treatment. They work independently: finasteride internally, minoxidil on the scalp. In fact, some evidence suggests that using both can allow you to use a lower dose of each (for example, some doctors suggest that if a patient is very sensitive to finasteride, using minoxidil as well might allow maintaining results with less frequent finasteride dosing – but that’s something to only adjust with medical guidance). Generally, you’ll just monitor for each medication’s effects. Many men take both long-term without issues.
	•	Your health history: You noted a past TB infection; there’s no direct link between that and these hair meds, so you shouldn’t expect any special side effects related to TB. Finasteride doesn’t weaken your immune system or anything like that. Just ensure you’re not on other meds that could interact (for example, if you were on isotretinoin for acne, that’s fine with finasteride; if you were on blood pressure meds, minoxidil can theoretically lower blood pressure a bit, but that’s usually only oral minoxidil at higher doses). If you have any specific conditions like liver or kidney issues, discuss those – but otherwise, these treatments are well-tolerated by young healthy men.

Bottom line: Both finasteride and minoxidil have been used by millions worldwide and have a strong safety profile. Every medication has potential side effects, but in this case serious effects are rare. Most users either have no side effects or only mild ones. It’s always a benefit-risk decision: for many men, keeping their hair and confidence is worth the very small risk of side effects. You can further minimize risk by following the prescribed usage, and keeping an open line with the healthcare provider if you have concerns. Hims will likely provide you with info about what to watch for. If side effects do occur and persist, you can stop the medication – your body will metabolize finasteride out of your system in days, and side effects usually resolve. Minoxidil side effects (skin) also go away after stopping or switching formulations. So you’re not locked in if you don’t tolerate something. But chances are you’ll be absolutely fine on these meds, as most men are ￼.

Cost of Hims Treatment (What to Expect to Pay)

One of your questions was how much this would cost per month. Hims operates on a subscription model for these treatments. Here’s a breakdown of typical costs (in USD):
	•	Minoxidil (Hims 5% Topical Solution or Foam): Approximately $15 per month for a one-month supply ￼. Hims often sells a bottle as a one-month supply. This is comparable to buying generic minoxidil from a store (for example, Kirkland Signature minoxidil from Costco is about $10/month if bought in bulk). Hims’ convenience is that it arrives at your door on schedule.
	•	Finasteride (Hims 1 mg pills): Around $22–25 per month for a month’s supply ￼. GQ’s 2025 review noted Hims was selling it at ~$22/month ￼. The price can vary slightly; sometimes Hims might have 3-month plans that lower the effective monthly cost. For example, if you commit to a 3 or 6-month subscription, the monthly price might be a bit less. Innerbody (a review site) mentions Hims offers finasteride + minoxidil together starting at $32/month if you choose an annual plan ￼.
	•	Combined Packages: Hims often markets bundles. The “Hair Loss Duo” (finasteride + minoxidil) was cited at $32 per month (with an annual plan) or around $39/month on a quarter-by-quarter plan ￼. This includes both medications. They also have a bigger bundle called the “Hair Power Pack” (finasteride, minoxidil, a DHT-blocking shampoo, and biotin gummies) which is about $60 per month ￼. That’s more comprehensive but you may or may not want the extras. The basic two medications are the most crucial parts.
	•	Consultation fees: Hims’ model usually includes the initial online consultation with a licensed healthcare provider for free or a small fee. Often the cost of the medical evaluation is built into the medication price. There shouldn’t be a separate large “doctor fee” – typically you pay just the subscription cost which covers the meds and any support (messaging the provider, etc.). According to Hims info, they provide 24/7 customer support and access to providers for questions as part of the service ￼ ￼. So you’re essentially paying for a all-in-one service.
	•	Shipping: Hims ships prescription products for free (within the U.S.), and charges a small shipping fee (like $5) for over-the-counter products if ordered alone ￼. If you’re getting finasteride (a prescription) in your order, usually shipping is included.
	•	No insurance, but…: Hims (and similar services like Keeps, Roman) do not bill insurance. Insurance generally doesn’t cover medications for hair loss anyway (since it’s considered cosmetic). However, Hims tries to keep prices relatively affordable compared to brand-name prescriptions. For reference, brand name Propecia (finasteride) could cost ~$70+ a month at retail, but generic finasteride is cheap – Hims’ price of ~$20-25 is in line with out-of-pocket generic prices (you might find generic finasteride at a local pharmacy for anywhere from $10 to $30 a month using a coupon). Minoxidil OTC is inexpensive (about $10-15/month). So Hims charges roughly the market rate or a bit above, with the premium being the convenience and medical oversight.

To summarize: If you go with the basic finasteride + minoxidil plan through Hims, expect roughly ~$30–40 per month total. If you only use one of them, it’ll be around $15 (minoxidil alone) or ~$22 (finasteride alone) per month. Hims’ own site mentions their hair loss products range from $15 up to $60 per month, depending on what you choose ￼.

It’s a good idea to price compare briefly: Some users alternate between services or use Hims for the prescription then fill it at a local pharmacy if cheaper. Hims does allow you to have your prescription sent to a local pharmacy if you prefer ￼. For instance, if your insurance by any chance would cover finasteride (rare, unless for prostate issues) or if you want to use a GoodRx coupon at CVS, you could. But given insurance typically doesn’t cover hair loss meds, you’d be paying out of pocket either way – in that case, Hims’ all-in-one service is very convenient.

One more cost aspect: Hims frequently offers promotions for first-time customers or for bundling. While they might not have a first-month almost-free deal (Keeps sometimes does first month cheap), you might come across promo codes. Check if there’s a discounted first month or some trial offer – sometimes they advertise things like “first month for $5” for certain products, then regular price after ￼. Just read the fine print so you know when it renews at full price.

Overall, anticipate on the order of a dollar or two per day for the treatment – which for many is a worthwhile investment in keeping your hair.

Health Savings Account (HSA) – Will It Cover This?

You asked about HSA coverage. If you have an HSA (Health Savings Account) with funds, yes, you should be able to use it for Hims hair loss treatments. An HSA covers qualifying medical expenses, and prescription medications are qualified expenses. Finasteride is a prescription medication, and even though minoxidil is OTC, when you get it through Hims as part of a treatment plan it’s essentially recommended by a medical provider.

Importantly, while Hims doesn’t take insurance, they do accept HSA or FSA cards for payment ￼. Hims’ own site states that you can pay with HSA/FSA accounts for their products (Happy Head, a competitor, does not, interestingly) ￼. This means you can likely just enter your HSA debit card when paying for the subscription and it should go through, using your tax-advantaged funds. If for some reason that doesn’t work, another approach is to pay with a normal card and then submit the receipt for reimbursement from your HSA administrator – but Hims explicitly says they accept HSA, which simplifies things.

Do keep documentation (receipts) of the purchases as an HSA could ask for proof it was a medical expense. Your Hims pharmacy receipts or order summaries should show finasteride (a prescription drug) which is clearly HSA-eligible. Minoxidil OTC is a gray area for HSA normally unless you have a prescription for it – however, since it’s bundled in your medical treatment plan through Hims, it should qualify. In practice, HSA/FSA often covers OTC meds if you have a prescription or doctor recommendation. Given Hims will have a provider “prescribing” the minoxidil as part of the plan, it counts.

So bottom line: Your HSA can cover this expense. You’ll be using pre-tax dollars, effectively saving some money. Just note that insurance plans themselves won’t cover Hims (you can’t, say, have your Blue Cross pay Hims directly), but HSA isn’t insurance – it’s your own money set aside for health. Since Hims accepts HSA, it’s pretty straightforward in this case ￼.

The Commitment: Do I Have to Use These Forever?

This is a very important question: Do you need to keep using finasteride/minoxidil for life? The honest answer is yes – for as long as you want to maintain the results. These treatments are not a permanent cure; they only work while you use them. If you stop, the biological process of hair miniaturization will resume, and any gains will be lost over time ￼.

Think of it like treating a chronic condition – similar to how blood pressure medication only works if you keep taking it. In hair loss, the underlying tendency (genetics + hormones) never “goes away”, so you have to continually counteract it. Here’s what happens if you stop:
	•	Stopping Finasteride: Within a few weeks of stopping, your DHT levels will go back up to normal. Hair that was being protected from DHT will once again be exposed. Typically, over the ensuing several months, you will gradually lose the hair that finasteride was helping to keep. Clinical studies showed that any hair count improvements from finasteride revert to baseline by 9–12 months after stopping the drug. Essentially, you’d catch up to where you would have been if you never took it (there may even be a bit of “rebound” shedding as DHT surges back). Many users who quit finasteride report a significant shed around the 3-6 month mark after discontinuation. Abrupt stoppage often leads to shedding of the hair that was retained or regrown during treatment ￼. So, if you use it for 5 years, keep a lot of hair, then quit, you might lose a good chunk of hair over the next year as the balding process “catches up.”
	•	Stopping Minoxidil: Similarly, minoxidil’s gains are not permanent without it. Minoxidil keeps hair in the growth phase longer and revitalizes shrunken follicles. If you stop applying it, those follicles will regress. Typically, any new hairs grown from minoxidil will shed within a few months after stopping, and you’ll likely see increased hair loss about 2-3 months post-discontinuation. In studies, the hair count returns to baseline (or worse) by 3-6 months after stopping minoxidil. Many dermatologists warn patients not to stop cold turkey if they’ve had good results, because you can lose a lot fairly quickly when treatment is withdrawn. It’s often described that you’ll lose not only the new hairs but possibly also some hair that was being held onto that would have fallen out earlier without treatment.

Given this, the general advice is: plan for long-term use. As long as you’re concerned about keeping your hair, you’ll want to continue the medication. This can sound daunting (“as long as I’m alive?!”), but think of it like a daily routine, similar to brushing teeth. Many men take a 1 mg finasteride pill every morning for decades without issues, and apply minoxidil as part of their grooming routine. If cost is a concern long-term, remember that generic options exist and costs could even come down. If side effects are a concern, know that you can periodically reassess the necessity (for instance, some men in their late 40s or 50s decide to stop treatment if they feel they’ve aged into a look they are comfortable with, etc.). But at 28, you likely have many years of caring about your hair ahead.

One hopeful aspect: if truly effective new treatments or even a cure (like hair cloning or advanced gene therapies) emerge in the future, you could re-evaluate then. But currently, finasteride and minoxidil are the gold standard maintenance treatments, and staying on them is the trade-off for keeping your hair. If you stop and lose ground, you can always restart treatment and regain some of it, but it’s harder to recover hair than to maintain it. So it’s best to not interrupt if possible.

To make long-term use easier, integrate it into your daily life: e.g., keep your pill bottle by your toothbrush (take a pill after brushing teeth), and apply minoxidil after your shower when hair is damp (morning and night). After a while, it becomes second nature. Should you one day decide the hassle/cost isn’t worth it, that’s your choice – just be aware of the likely hair loss return. But given how much it affects your confidence now, you will probably find the routine well worth the confidence boost.

User Satisfaction and Results: What Are Others Saying?

It’s understandable to want to know if other users are satisfied with Hims and these treatments. The general feedback on finasteride and minoxidil (whether from Hims or elsewhere) is positive in terms of effectiveness – they really do work for a majority of men, which is why they’ve been the standard treatments for decades. Many men report they’ve been able to keep their hair and even regrow some, which greatly improved their self-esteem. For example, in a long-term clinical follow-up, over 85% of men on finasteride for 5 years showed visible improvement or no further hair loss progression, which is a strong success rate ￼. Minoxidil likewise has a high response rate, with about 80%+ of men getting some benefit as noted earlier.

In terms of subjective satisfaction: Studies and surveys indicate most men are happy with the results, though not everyone gets everything they hoped for. In one survey after a year of minoxidil use, patients rated their satisfaction on average around 4.4 out of 10 (up from 2.9 at baseline) ￼. That sounds low, but keep in mind some people have high expectations. The same study’s objective measurements showed the majority had slowing of hair loss and regrowth, even though self-rated satisfaction was modest ￼. The takeaway is that some users wish for more hair regrowth than what current medicine can give. However, many testimonials from real users (on forums like Reddit’s r/tressless, or Hims/Keeps reviews) are quite encouraging. They often say things like: “I noticed my shedding stopped and my bald spot filled in a bit – it’s not miraculous, but I’m so relieved” or “Finasteride basically halted my receding hairline. I’ve been on it 3 years and haven’t lost any more ground”. Some men even share before-and-after photos showing visibly thicker hair after 6-12 months. Hims’ website itself features before/after results from customers: for instance, some users report “my hair keeps growing thicker, fuller, and at a fast rate” with treatment ￼. Keep in mind those are likely happy customers being highlighted. Not everyone will have dramatic photos, but even moderate improvements can feel great.

As for Hims as a service, reviews are mixed but generally good. People like the convenience and privacy. Some common feedback: The process is easy – you fill out the questionnaire, provide some photos of your hair, and a licensed provider reviews it. Many get approved and shipped meds within a few days. Users appreciate not having to visit a doctor in person for what can be an embarrassing issue. On the flip side, a few users have complained about things like “after using the Hims hair spray (topical combo) for a month I had itching and they wouldn’t refund” ￼ or delays in customer service. But such experiences vary. Overall, Hims has a large customer base for hair loss, indicating people are finding it effective. Innerbody’s 2025 review of Hims hair loss services concluded that Hims “knocks it out of the park” in customizing treatments and that these are “without question some of the most effective hair loss treatments” available ￼ ￼. The main caution is to manage expectations and be informed (which you are doing!).

It might also help to know that if Hims weren’t effective, it wouldn’t be so popular – it’s popular because it provides access to meds that are known to work. Many users are indeed satisfied when they see their hair stabilizing or improving. There will always be some who are unhappy (e.g. those who got side effects or didn’t respond as much as hoped). But statistically, you’re likely to have a positive experience in terms of results.

One more note: Psychological benefit – even in cases where hair regrowth is small, just taking action can make you feel better. Knowing “I’m doing something about it” often improves confidence and outlook, compared to helplessly watching hair fall out. And when you do start seeing little improvements (like less scalp showing or a stronger hairline), it’s a great feeling.

Conclusion: Should You Proceed with Hims?

Given all the research and data, it appears that proceeding with the Hims hair loss plan (finasteride + minoxidil) is a sound decision for someone in your situation. These treatments are currently the best available, evidence-backed options for male pattern hair loss ￼ ￼. Let’s recap the key points to help you decide:
	•	Effectiveness: Both finasteride and minoxidil have high success rates in slowing hair loss and promoting regrowth. Finasteride in particular is crucial for protecting your hairline from further recession (since DHT is the culprit) ￼. Minoxidil will complement it by stimulating new growth. Using them together gives you the maximum chance of noticeable improvement ￼. At 28 and early in hair loss, you are an ideal candidate to benefit – you can likely maintain most of your existing hair and thicken it up over the next year. This can make you look younger and boost your confidence, addressing the feelings of looking “old” that you mentioned.
	•	Safety: While no medication is 100% free of side effects, these are generally safe for long-term use in men. Most users do not experience significant issues. The main risk (finasteride’s sexual side effects) is low in probability ￼, and you can monitor for it. You’re informed now, so you can weigh that small risk against the benefit of keeping your hair. Minoxidil’s side effects are minimal and mostly just an inconvenience (dry scalp, etc.) for a minority. Neither drug poses a serious health risk for a typical user, and any side effects usually subside if the drug is discontinued ￼. With your medical history (past TB) there’s no contraindication noted – just ensure the Hims provider knows your history, which you’ve already answered in the questionnaire. Based on the info, there’s no red flag that would prevent you from using these medications.
	•	Cost: Hims provides a fair price and great convenience. For around $1–$2 a day you can treat your hair loss. If you have an HSA, you can effectively pay with pre-tax money, saving you maybe ~20-30% in taxes, which is a bonus ￼. Over the years, yes, it’s an ongoing expense – but many find it well worth it for the quality of life improvement. Also, consider that hair transplants (an alternative some pursue) cost thousands up front; finasteride/minoxidil is a much more affordable approach by comparison.
	•	Commitment: Be prepared that this is a long-term commitment. You should go in with the mindset that you’ll be using these treatments indefinitely (or at least for many years) to maintain the results ￼. If you’re okay with that, you’re set. If the idea of “forever” is daunting, remember you can always reassess later in life. But stopping will likely reverse the gains, so it’s best to continue once you start. Many men incorporate it into their routine and don’t find it burdensome – especially once they see it working, it becomes worth it to keep going.
	•	Satisfaction: Chances are, you will be more satisfied with your hair a year from now if you start treatment than if you do nothing. Seeing improvement (even if gradual) can greatly improve your self-image. And even knowing you’ve taken control of the situation can relieve some of the embarrassment you currently feel. You won’t be alone – plenty of Hims users in their late 20s report feeling better about themselves after sticking to the treatment for a while. Just keep realistic expectations (it’s about improvement and maintenance, not perfection), and you’re likely to be pleased.
	•	Alternatives: If for any reason Hims doesn’t appeal (say you want a second opinion), you could also visit a dermatologist in person. They would likely recommend the exact same regimen: finasteride 1 mg and minoxidil 5%. The difference is you might get a prescription to fill at a pharmacy. But given you’re seeing Hims everywhere and it’s convenient, there’s no issue using Hims – it’s a legitimate healthcare provider with licensed practitioners. Many people successfully use these telehealth services now for hair loss.
	•	Your confidence: You mentioned not feeling confident going out with your hair as it is. Taking action by starting treatment is a proactive step that can help you feel more in control. Within a few months, you may notice you’re not as self-conscious, especially if shedding slows and you see a bit of regrowth. Over time, as your hair stabilizes or improves, you’ll likely feel less embarrassed and more like your young self again.

Considering all of the above, my suggestion is to go ahead with the Hims questionnaire and treatment plan. Ensure you answer all the medical questions truthfully (which it seems you have: e.g., noting your past TB, etc.). The Hims provider will review and, in all likelihood, approve you for the finasteride and minoxidil treatment if there are no contraindications. Once you get the meds, use them exactly as directed. It may help to document your baseline (take photos of your hair in good lighting now) so you can compare in 6 months. And don’t get discouraged early on – remember that results take time (it’s often said “think in terms of months, not days”). If you have questions or experience any issues, Hims allows you to message a provider for follow-up ￼. Use that resource – they can guide you if, say, you get side effect concerns or need a tweak in treatment.

Finally, using your HSA to pay will make it a bit easier financially, and mentally you can consider it an investment in your well-being. You’re effectively treating a condition that affects your quality of life, which is exactly what those HSA funds are for.

In summary, finasteride and minoxidil (whether via Hims or another route) are the best first-line treatment for male pattern hair loss at 28. They are relatively low-risk, not too expensive (especially with HSA), and have a high chance of improving your hair if you stick with them. Most users are glad they took action when they see the outcome. Given your feelings of embarrassment and the early stage of your hair loss, it’s very likely worth it for you. Based on credible sources and clinical evidence, you can proceed with confidence that you’re using a well-established, effective approach to address your hair loss ￼ ￼. Good luck, and here’s to hoping you see great results in the coming months – a fuller head of hair and a big boost in confidence!
