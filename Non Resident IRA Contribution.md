Thank you for the details. I’ll look into whether nonresident aliens on F-1 visas with U.S.-source W-2 income can deduct Traditional IRA contributions, and what actions you can take if not—such as penalty-free withdrawals, recharacterization, or other remedies. I’ll also consider if using iTrustCapital affects your situation.

I’ll report back with a clear, step-by-step guide on the best course of action to stay compliant and minimize taxes or penalties.


# Traditional IRA Deductions and Corrections for a Nonresident Alien (F‑1 Visa Student)

## Eligibility to Deduct a Traditional IRA Contribution (F-1 Nonresident Alien)

As a nonresident alien on an F-1 visa with U.S. **W-2 wage income**, you **can contribute to a Traditional IRA** if you have taxable compensation (like wages) and are under the age limits (the SECURE Act removed the 70½ age cap). Importantly, **nonresident aliens may take an IRA deduction** on Form 1040-NR *if* they meet the requirements – the contribution must be connected to **effectively connected** U.S. income (your W-2 wages qualify) and not exempt from tax by a treaty. In summary:

* **Taxable U.S. Compensation:** You must have U.S.-source earned income that is subject to U.S. tax (e.g. your W-2 wages). Nonresident aliens can deduct IRA contributions **only to the extent of U.S. taxable compensation** (income exempt under a tax treaty can’t support an IRA deduction). Since you earned \$112,500 in U.S. wages and (presumably) are paying U.S. tax on that income, you have sufficient eligible compensation for an IRA contribution.
* **1040-NR Reporting:** The Traditional IRA deduction (if allowed) is taken as an **adjustment to income** on Schedule 1 (Form 1040) **Line 20**, even for 1040-NR filers. Nonresident aliens from India can also claim the standard deduction under the U.S.-India treaty Article 21, which does not affect IRA contributions directly. The key is that your IRA contribution will reduce your **effectively connected taxable income** on the 1040-NR if you qualify.

**However, there are additional limitations** that may prevent you from actually getting a deduction for your Traditional IRA contribution, even though you contributed:

* **Active Retirement Plan at Work:** If you (or your spouse, if you had one) were covered by an employer retirement plan in the year of contribution, Traditional IRA deductions are **income-restricted**. For a single filer in 2025, the deduction phases out between **\$79,000–\$89,000** of modified AGI. In other words, if your W-2 job provided a 401(k) or similar plan and you participated (Box 13 “Retirement Plan” on your W-2 would be checked), at \$112,500 income you **exceed the upper limit** – your Traditional IRA contribution would **not be deductible** due to the phase-out (your MAGI is above \$89k). If you were **not** covered by any workplace plan, this income phase-out **does not apply** and your full contribution could be deductible.
* **Contribution Limits:** Ensure the \$1,000 contribution is within annual IRA limits. The limit for 2025 is \$7,000 (under age 50). Your \$1,000 is well below this cap, so no issue there.
* **Nonresident Status:** Simply being a nonresident (F-1) does **not bar you from contributing or deducting** an IRA. The IRS explicitly allows IRA deductions for nonresident aliens with effectively-connected income. The misconception often arises because tax software (e.g. Sprintax) may not prompt for IRA contributions. You may need to manually enter it on Schedule 1. As long as you qualify (taxable wages, under income phase-out, etc.), you **can claim the deduction** on a 1040-NR.

**Bottom line:** You *can* deduct a Traditional IRA contribution on your 1040-NR **if** you have taxable U.S. wages and are within the income limits. In your case, the F-1 visa itself doesn’t prohibit the deduction. The main concern is whether your \$112,500 salary (and any retirement plan at work) allows the deduction. If you had no employer plan, a \$1,000 Traditional IRA contribution **would be fully deductible**. If you *were* covered by a plan, you’re above the phase-out range, meaning the contribution is **“non-deductible”** – you can still contribute, but it won’t reduce your tax owed.

## Options if Your IRA Contribution Isn’t Deductible or Allowed

If you discover that you **aren’t eligible to deduct** your Traditional IRA contribution (for example, due to the active-plan income limits or another disqualifier), don’t panic. You have remedies to fix or adjust the contribution and avoid any penalties. Since you contributed recently and the funds are not invested yet, you have two main options:

**1. Withdraw the Contribution (Return of Contribution):** If the contribution is **ineligible or unwanted**, you can remove it from the IRA as an “excess contribution withdrawal.” The IRS lets you withdraw the contribution (and any earnings on it) by the tax filing deadline, which for 2025 contributions is April 15, 2026 (or October 15, 2026 if you file an extension). Removing it by this deadline treats it as if it was never contributed.

* **No 6% Excise Tax:** By timely withdrawing the \$1,000, you avoid the **6% excise tax** that otherwise applies annually to excess IRA contributions left in the account (IRC §4973). Since your contribution would be “undone” before the deadline, no penalty applies for 2025.
* **No Early Withdrawal Penalty:** Normally, taking money out of a Traditional IRA before age 59½ carries a 10% early withdrawal penalty. **Importantly, an on-time removal of an excess contribution is exempt from the 10% penalty on any earnings**. The SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 explicitly *waived the 10% penalty on earnings* for timely corrections of excess or non-deductible contributions. In your case, because the \$1,000 was not invested and presumably earned no income, this is moot – there are likely no earnings. But even if there were a few dollars of interest, you’d pay **no 10% penalty** on those when removing the contribution in time.
* **Tax on Earnings (if any):** If your withdrawn contribution had generated any earnings while in the IRA, those earnings would need to be included in your income. They are taxed in the **year the contribution was made** (since you’re removing the 2025 contribution, any earnings would be reported on your 2025 return). The original \$1,000 itself is not taxed upon withdrawal because it was after-tax money (you didn’t deduct it). In your scenario (funds not invested), the earnings are effectively zero, so withdrawing \$1,000 should have **no tax impact**.
* **Process to Withdraw:**

  1. **Contact iTrustCapital** (your IRA custodian) and request a **“return of excess contribution” distribution** for the \$1,000 (plus any calculated net earnings). Per iTrustCapital’s guidance, you’d need to submit a distribution request to correct the contribution. Do this as soon as possible, certainly before the tax deadline.
  2. The custodian will compute any earnings or loss on the \$1,000 (if it sat in cash the whole time and no other assets in the account changed value, the net earnings should be zero).
  3. They will then distribute the \$1,000 back to you (typically via bank transfer or check). Because it’s a removal of current-year contribution, ask the custodian to code it appropriately as a **corrective distribution**.
  4. **Tax Reporting:** The withdrawal will be reported by iTrust on Form **1099-R** (issued in January 2026 if you withdraw in 2025 or early 2026). The 1099-R will have a special code (likely **PJ** or **8**/**P** depending on timing) indicating a withdrawal of an excess contribution. Since it’s timely, it won’t be subject to the 10% penalty. You will *not* get a “corrected” Form 5498 for the contribution – the IRS will still see a 2025 contribution was made, but they’ll also see the 1099-R showing it was removed.
  5. On your tax return, you simply **do not take the IRA deduction**. If there were any earnings withdrawn, you would report those as other income (and attach Form 5329 only if a penalty applied, which it won’t in a timely withdrawal). Since you contributed and removed in the same year (2025), and had no earnings, there’s nothing new to report on the 1040-NR aside from not deducting the IRA. Keep documentation of the withdrawal with your records in case of questions.

*Example:* Suppose you had invested the \$1,000 and it grew to \$1,050 by year-end 2025. If you withdraw it all by April 15, 2026, you’d include the \$50 of earnings as income on your 2025 return, but **no 10% penalty** would apply to that \$50. The \$1,000 original contribution remains non-taxable on withdrawal (since it was never deducted). This correction avoids any long-term consequences.

**2. Recharacterize the Contribution to a Roth IRA:** Recharacterization is an IRS-sanctioned method to “**undo**” a contribution to one type of IRA by **treating it as if it had been contributed to another type of IRA originally**. In your case, since a Traditional IRA contribution isn’t yielding a deduction (and assuming you’re otherwise eligible for a Roth IRA), you can elect to **recharacterize the \$1,000 as a Roth IRA contribution**. This keeps the money in a retirement account but switches its character to after-tax. Key points about recharacterization:

* **Deadline:** You must complete a recharacterization by the **tax filing deadline, including extensions** for the tax year of the contribution. For a 2025 contribution, that means on or before April 15, 2026 (or Oct 15, 2026 if you file an extension). It’s wise to initiate the process well before the deadline to allow the custodian time to process it.
* **No Tax or Penalty:** A recharacterization is **not a taxable event** – there are *no penalties or distribution taxes* when done properly. The contribution is simply reclassified. The IRS treats it as if you originally contributed \$1,000 to a Roth IRA instead of a Traditional IRA. There is no 10% penalty, and no income tax on the transferred amount or its earnings at the time of recharacterization.
* **Procedure to Recharacterize:**

  1. **Open a Roth IRA** with iTrustCapital (if you don’t already have one on the platform).
  2. **Request in writing to iTrustCapital to recharacterize** your \$1,000 Traditional IRA contribution (plus any attributable earnings) as a Roth IRA contribution for the same tax year. Essentially, you are instructing the custodian to move \$1,000 from your Traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account and mark it as a recharacterization. Provide details like the date and amount of the original contribution and state that it’s for the 2025 tax year. iTrustCapital, like other custodians, will have forms or an online process for this – you may need to contact their support for the exact steps.
  3. The custodian will calculate any net earnings on the \$1,000 (if it was just in cash, earnings \~ \$0). Both the original amount and any earnings will transfer into the Roth IRA. **All those funds are now considered Roth IRA assets** as if they’d been in Roth all along. (If there were earnings transferred, those earnings are not taxed now – they will eventually be tax-free if you meet Roth withdrawal rules, since they grew inside the Roth retroactively.)
  4. **Reporting the Recharacterization:** iTrustCapital will issue a Form 1099-R for 2025 (or 2026) showing a non-taxable transfer (code **R** or **N**) of \$1,000 (and earnings, if any) from the Traditional IRA, and a Form 5498 for the Roth IRA showing a \$1,000 recharacterized contribution. On your tax return, **do not deduct** the \$1,000 Traditional IRA – instead, you’ll treat it as a Roth contribution. Roth contributions are not reported as deductions, so nothing directly goes on your 1040-NR form for the contribution itself. It’s recommended to **attach a brief explanation statement** to your return explaining that you originally contributed \$1,000 to a Traditional IRA on X date, and that you recharacterized it to a Roth IRA on Y date. This way the IRS has a record.
  5. **Ensure Roth Eligibility:** Before recharacterizing, confirm that you are eligible to contribute to a Roth for that year. Roth IRAs have income limits as well – for 2025, the phase-out for single filers starts at **\$150,000** MAGI (and ends at \$165,000). With \$112,500 income, you are safely under the Roth income limit, so a \$1,000 Roth contribution is allowed. (If your income had been above the Roth limit, recharacterizing directly to Roth would create an excess Roth contribution – in such case one might instead leave it as a non-deductible Traditional IRA or do a backdoor Roth conversion. But this is not an issue for you given your income level.)
* **Result of Recharacterization:** Now it’s as if you originally put the \$1,000 into a **Roth IRA**. You receive **no upfront deduction** – instead, the money will grow tax-free and qualified withdrawals in the future will be tax-free. You’ve effectively “fixed” the issue of an un-deductible Traditional IRA by turning it into a Roth contribution (which wouldn’t be deductible anyway, but provides future tax-free growth). There’s no need to track a basis on Form 8606 for this contribution, because it’s no longer in the Traditional IRA. (Had you left it in the Traditional IRA as a non-deductible contribution, you’d use Form 8606 to record the \$1,000 basis to avoid double taxation later.)

*Example:* You contributed \$1,000 to a Traditional IRA in 2025 but found you couldn’t deduct it. By June 2025, that \$1,000 is still \$1,000. You recharacterize it to a Roth IRA. On your 2025 return, you attach a note but take no deduction. Later, suppose that \$1,000 grows to \$1,500 in the Roth by the time you qualify to withdraw – that \$500 gain can be tax-free. Had you left it in a Traditional IRA non-deductible, that \$500 gain would eventually be taxable upon withdrawal (though the \$1,000 would come out tax-free as return of basis). Recharacterizing thus positions you better for tax-free growth. There are **no immediate taxes or penalties** for doing this.

**Which Option to Choose?** If you simply want to undo the contribution and avoid any complexity, a **withdrawal (return of contribution)** is straightforward – you get your \$1,000 back now with no penalty or tax cost. If your goal is to **keep the money earmarked for retirement** and you just want to fix the deductibility issue, **recharacterizing to Roth** is a great solution (since you weren’t getting a deduction anyway, you might as well enjoy Roth treatment going forward). Many taxpayers in your situation choose the Roth recharacterization so that the contribution isn’t wasted. Just be mindful of the timelines for whichever route you choose and follow through before the deadlines.

## Impact of Using iTrustCapital as the IRA Custodian

Using iTrustCapital (a self-directed IRA platform often used for alternative investments like crypto) **does not change the IRS rules** above – it’s simply the custodian of your Traditional IRA. You have the **same ability to correct or recharacterize contributions** with iTrustCapital as you would with any mainstream brokerage, though the exact procedure may differ slightly:

* **Reversing (Withdrawing) the Contribution:** iTrustCapital explicitly allows for correcting over-contributions. Their guidance says that if you have an excess contribution, you should work with a tax professional and then **submit a distribution request** to remove the excess funds. In practice, this means you would log into your iTrustCapital account (or contact their support) and request a distribution of the \$1,000 contribution back to you. They will likely have you fill out a form or an online request indicating this is a removal of current-year contribution. Once processed, you’ll receive the funds and later a 1099-R form as discussed. **Using iTrustCapital does not impose any extra penalty or restriction** on this – they must adhere to IRS rules. Just ensure you initiate the removal **before the tax deadline** and confirm with them that it will be coded as a timely correction (to avoid the 6% excise tax). Since your funds are in cash and not invested on the platform, the transaction should be quick and without needing to liquidate assets (if you had invested in crypto or metals via iTrust, you’d likely need to sell enough to free up \$1,000 for the distribution).

* **Recharacterizing via iTrustCapital:** Recharacterization is also possible with iTrustCapital, but it may require a bit of coordination. Not all online dashboards have a one-click recharacterize option, so you might need to **contact iTrustCapital’s support** and inform them you want to recharacterize a 2025 Traditional IRA contribution to a Roth IRA. They may direct you to open a Roth IRA account on their platform (if you haven’t already) to receive the funds. According to general IRS procedure, you will need to provide a written instruction that includes the original contribution details and a request to transfer the contribution plus earnings to the Roth IRA. Ask iTrustCapital if they have a specific **form for recharacterizations** or if a secure message/letter is required. Some custodians have internal forms to handle this. Make sure to initiate this well ahead of the deadline, as the transfer between accounts can take time. Once completed, iTrustCapital will update your account balances (your Traditional IRA will lose the \$1,000, and your Roth IRA will gain \$1,000). They will handle the tax reporting (1099-R and 5498 forms) to reflect the recharacterization. **The fact that it’s iTrustCapital (and not, say, Fidelity) does not limit your right to recharacterize** – all IRA custodians must follow IRS rules. The only difference might be the customer service process to get it done. It’s a good idea to get confirmation in writing from iTrust that the recharacterization was executed, and keep that for your records.

* **No Special Restrictions:** There is no rule that an F-1 visa holder using a particular platform cannot undo or change an IRA contribution. iTrustCapital’s role is simply to carry out your instructions within the bounds of the law. The **IRA is governed by IRS regulations**, not by the platform. So you have the full range of options (withdrawal, recharacterization, or even leaving it as a nondeductible Traditional IRA) at your disposal. The key is to communicate with iTrustCapital and possibly your CPA to do it correctly.

* **One Consideration – Alternative Investments:** If your IRA money had been invested in something illiquid (for example, if you had used the \$1,000 to buy a small amount of cryptocurrency or gold via iTrustCapital), reversing the contribution would require selling that investment back to cash. In your case, since you “have not yet invested the funds,” you can skip that step. This makes the correction very clean. Using iTrust for the custodian does not change tax outcomes, but be mindful that **any assets must be converted to cash** for distribution or moved in-kind if recharacterizing. Given that your \$1,000 is just sitting as cash, iTrust will likely just transfer cash between your Traditional and Roth IRAs for a recharacterization, or send you the cash for a withdrawal.

**Summary of Action Steps:** To resolve your situation, here is a concise step-by-step game plan:

* **Step 1:** Decide whether you want to **withdraw the contribution or recharacterize it to Roth**. (If you do nothing, the \$1,000 will remain in a Traditional IRA as a non-deductible contribution. This isn’t catastrophic – you’d just file Form 8606 to track the \$1,000 basis – but it may not be optimal since a Roth could be better for growth, or you might prefer to have the cash now.)
* **Step 2 (Withdrawal Option):** If withdrawing, contact iTrustCapital and **request a return of the \$1,000 contribution** *as an excess*. Do this before April 15, 2026 (or Oct 15, 2026 if extended) to ensure it’s timely. Confirm that no earnings accrued; the distribution should be \$1,000. When you file your 2025 tax return, **do not deduct** the IRA. There will be no additional tax owed or penalties. (If a Form 5329 is generated by software for an “excess,” it would show \$0 penalty due to timely withdrawal.) Keep the 1099-R you get in early 2026 for your records (it will document the removal in case the IRS ever inquires).
* **Step 2 (Recharacterization Option):** If recharacterizing, open a **Roth IRA account** with iTrustCapital if you haven’t already. **Submit a recharacterization request** to iTrustCapital for the \$1,000 2025 Traditional IRA contribution (plus any minuscule earnings). Ensure this is done by the tax deadline (including extensions). Double-check that your income is under the Roth limit (it is). On your tax return, again, **do not deduct** the \$1,000 – instead, attach a short explanation of the recharacterization. No Form 5329 is needed, and Form 8606 is not required since you are not leaving any nondeductible amount in a Traditional IRA. Going forward, that \$1,000 sits in your Roth IRA for investment as you see fit.
* **Step 3:** Follow up with iTrustCapital to get confirmation of the transaction. After the correction, **monitor for tax forms**: For a withdrawal, a 1099-R will arrive; for a recharacterization, a 1099-R (for the Traditional IRA showing a nontaxable transfer) and a Form 5498 (for the Roth) will be issued. These forms usually come in May since recharacterizations can be done up to the deadline. Match these with what you report on the return.
* **Step 4:** When you prepare your 2025 return (or 2024 if this was actually a late 2024 contribution – adjust years accordingly), make sure the IRA deduction line is either left blank or zero. Double-check that no 6% penalty (Form 5329 Part III) is being assessed. If you withdrew timely or recharacterized, you should **not owe any penalty or additional tax**.

By taking these steps, you’ll be in compliance with IRS rules and avoid any unintended tax consequences. You’ll either have your \$1,000 back in hand or safely in a Roth IRA for the future, with **no penalty incurred**. Using iTrustCapital doesn’t hinder these solutions – just be proactive in communicating your needs to them. Always keep documentation of what was done and when, in case you need to substantiate it later.
